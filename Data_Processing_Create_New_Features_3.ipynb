The space was big, had great AC, lots of great spots nearby.  La ubicaciÃ³n del alojamiento es muy buena ( cuenta con tres paradas de metro cercanas), hay supermercados en la zona y locales  para tomar algo o en los que puedes escuchar mÃºsica en directo. Conrad es muy atento y respondiÃ³ y solucionÃ³ todos los problemas que le planteamos. Como cosas a mejorar, seÃ±alarÃ\\xada la mejorable limpieza de las zonas comunes (especialmente el baÃ±o) y el hecho de que para 11 dÃ\\xadas de estancia sÃ³lo nos entregÃ³ una toalla. Por todo lo demÃ¡s , me parece recomendable. Conrad was super nice and communicated well with me. The room was clean and comfortable too! Also we were near plenty of subway stops, Domino park, and more. It really helped me and my friends enjoy our NYC experience.  Nice place to stay, good neighbourhood, Conrad communicates well. Great value for money. I recommend it. The apartment is surrounded by several subway options, which was very convenient. The building did not have an elevator, though, which was a bit challenging. Conrad's place has lots of good options for dining out within walking distance, which was a plus. There was quite a lot of noise from street parties at night, but overall we had a nice weekend in NYC. great service  with hospitality The location was awesome and Conrad was a great and friendly host. Definitely would recommend.  Conrad was very welcoming. Room was perfect for a place to crash at night.  Conrad nous a arrangÃ© un bon accueil - le dialogue et la communication Ã©taient parfaits. Lâ\\x80\\x99appartement se situe au pied du pont de Manahattan Ã\\xa0 quelques pas du mÃ©tro, au coeur d'un quartier trÃ¨s animÃ©. La chambre bien amÃ©nagÃ©e pour 5 personnes est sur cour, confortable et relativement isolÃ©e du bruit  ; la salle de bain et la cuisine sont pratiques. Au plaisir d'y retourner !  Will recommend  Great place to stay, located nearby to almost anything you need. Easy access and good neighborhood.  Awesome location and great deal for the area. Full-sized (larger than twin) beds, including the bunks, were more comfortable than expected. Friendly host with good local knowledge, apartment in good location!

The place and the neighborhood look really nice. I would recommend them as hosts. Great sports atmosphere, nice large screen TV to watch football while getting ready for the evening.

Jenima was a super nice and accommodating host. The place was clean and well decorated and the AC worked perfectly. Both the bed and the air mattress were comfortable. And her cat was super cute!  Beautiful apartment!  Great place great host sweet cat ! Everything was perfect :) thanks  Jenima's place is incredibly cosy and pleasant. Interior design of the private room is stylish and distinguished. The building really keeps a particular appeal due to the spirit of the time when it was realized. The position is good, pretty close to some subway stations and Prospect park. The neighborhood is lively and sometimes a little noisy, but that only adds some spice to the whole location. La camera nell'alloggio di Jenima Ã¨ dotata di tutti i comfort, dall'aria condizionata al wi-fi, tv... La zona di Brooklyn dove Ã¨ situato Ã¨ molto caratteristica e tranquilla e si possono trovare tutti i servizi. La metropolitana Ã¨ a 7 minuti a piedi e da lÃ¬ in 20 minuti si raggiunge Manhattan. Consigliato per 2/3 persone, in 4 si sta un po' stretti ma a NY si sta fuori tutto il giorno! Jenima Ã¨ stata molto carina e disponibile con noi, ci ha fatto sentire proprio a casa. Ultima nota per il suo gatto Auto, sempre in cerca di coccole e crocchette. Torneremo a trovarti!!! Everything You need is in this place. It was enjoy to  be there! Jenima is an amazing host and this place was great to stay in, I felt like I was at home immediately. Would stay here forever if I could.\"),\n",

Great for the price! A ton of restaurants within blocks. Loved the location!!  Hi! The place was really nice, the room was true to the pics. I thought the entire apartment was cute lol. The room itself reminded me of a small hotel room. It was clean and comfy and the bathroom was awesome very stylish/modern. Most importantly in this summer heat the A/C was nice and COLD. Lol. The place was very easy to get to, and there was everything you could possibly want right  in the middle of Williamsburg. Conrad was a really nice person, very friendly and chill. I would totally recommend staying here. I would sum up the vibe of staying here by saying it's like you had a really cool hipster/ artsy friend who let you stay at their really cool hipster/artsy apartment. Yup, that's what it was like.  Iâ\\x80\\x99d recommend! Conrad was a great host. His communication for checkin and checkout was great. He gave us tips about transportation and eating options. His place is close to subway and we were very happy with overall experience. Great host, great place Great spot. Very close to everything you would need.  Conrad was a great host, who was available for a nice chat and gave us helpful tipps about places to visit. Would definatly recommend staying at his place! This place is in an ideal location - very easy to get to the subway (a few blocks away). There are cafes and stores all over, the people around the neighborhood were quite friendly. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no lift in the apartment block so better pack light because we had to learn the hard way, Conradâ\\x80\\x99s apartment  is on the 4th floor. \\n\\nThe furniture was in good condition, a very comfy bed. Also had a very hipster aesthetic which we like but unfortunately it was not clean at all. We were two girls so we really tried to keep the spaces where we slept tidy but one can only do so much. Honestly with a good clean I would only then recommend this place cause location is everything.  Conrad place is comfortable. It was quiet and the AC was great. We had a great stay and slept very well. Would recommend! Conrad was great. Responsive and available when needed. The place was clean and nice. Conradâ\\x80\\x99s place is in a central spot of Williamsburg. Great coffee shop nearby and close to the subway. He has mastered having multiple people in his place. It was very clean. Very nice 4th floor walk-up. Great bed. Host is a great guy. Close to the heart of Williamsburg. I just can't bring myself to give top marks to the value - but it's NYC and the value IS fine!

The terrace is a wonderful amenity which is quite rare in New York. Bathroom may be small and tight for 4 guests but still doable.

It was amazing having that advantage specially since you only had to take 1 metro down to get downtown within 25-35 minutes. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s two other bedrooms in this apartment so chances are youâ\\x80\\x99ll be sharing the washroom and common areas with other people. Thankfully, the other couple that was staying at the same time as us were leaving earlier than us so we didnâ\\x80\\x99t have much issues with the washroom. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a convenience store right beside the condo so that made it great for grabbing some groceries. Check out the coffee shop in the corner of La Salle and Broadway. They have great almond croissants. We saw Frank when we checked in and then communicated with him via the Airbnb app for the checkout. The check in process was amazing.

Key pickup is one block away, but was easy. One set of steep stairs lead up to the apartment. We were there for a week, and really the only night that was loud was Friday night, and even that wasn't that bad for us. We brought noise machines apps on our ipads and slept fine the whole time. Location sure can't be beat! We had a great stay, and would have  stayed longer if we could.  Candy did recently remodel and it reflects the pictures. The furnishings are very quaint and adorable now. Unfortunately the description of check in and the location are not accurate. There is still NO lock box to access the keys. The address given connects you to a bar a couple blocks away and you have to ask around for someone to get you the keys and walk you to wear the actual airbnb is. It is not exactly an easy process, but it worked. Candy did not respond to messages day of to explain and clarify this. We just had to show up and hope that everything would work out. Also, the noise comments are also VERY true. When we got home on Friday night, I swear the bed was shaking from the noise. The floor of the bedrooms are also the ceiling of Madame X's below. If you go out on the weekend, then this should not be a big issue for you trying to get to sleep. I can comment that Sunday night was considerably quieter.  This air bnb is in an awesome location. Great restaurants and bars nearby, and washington square park is blocks away. The house is spacious, but there are a ton of stairs so pack light. The air bnb gives the address to the bar the owner manages and its a nice place with nice people, the asst manager took us to the apt around the corner. I thought this was super sketch prior to going but its not. The bar isnt a hole in the wall or anything. The street is pretty lively. Just make sure to look at the address of the apt as they dont give it to you. :) The location is enough to rent this place. Great stay\"),\n",

Their house is centrally located in Queens near Kew Gardens and a short walk to public transportation and several restaurants.  As a reference, their house is about a 30 min drive in traffic and $25 Uber from LaGuardia and 10-15 min drive and $16 Uber to JFK. \\nI would definitely recommend their home as a place to stay.

       "  'First of all thank you Yossi for the super fast responses. We booked another apartment in New York and the host cancelled our reservation 3 days before the arrival. We were super lucky to find this apartment available!! \\nGreat location in Upper West Side, residential and quiet neighborhood, a lot of bars and restaurants around and 1 block from Central Park. \\nThe apartment was clean, cozy and comfortable even if it looks renovated from the pictures. Maybe it needs a little remodel.  Great location in nice part of town, just off the centre but close and filled with places to eat. Communication was easy and the apartment pretty much as billed. Only real issue was small: the air con worked but did not really cool the place. Otherwise happy with clean studio in fine part of town. Yossi is very kind and worked to find a solution to the situation. I did not feel that the apartment was workable for me and did not wish to stay. She was very responsive and sent the cleaning crew back in to clean again and then ultimately worked hard to find a new tenant so that i could depart early.'),\n",

       "  '- After booking the room, the communication with the owner went well. When we arrived at the address, we collected the key to the house at the place he had indicated. Everything was fine. - When we opened the door, we were VERY SURPRISED TO BE WELCOMED BY A BIG BLACK DOG which was alone in the apartment. We were not expecting that at all. I don\\'t like dogs and I wouldn\\'t have booked the room, had I been aware that I would have to spend more than a week trying to be friendly with a dog... My wife tried to contain her panic. Fortunately, we quickly noticed that the dog was very very friendly and concluded that there was nothing to worry about. However, we wished we had been informed through the listing\\'s description that there was a dog in the apartment. - Our room was big enough, very clean, with air conditioner and a VERY COMFORTABLE BED. A calm environment. A kitchen which we were happy to use for preparing our breakfast, warming up our take away evening meals or cooking vegetables. Exactly what we wanted. - The apartment has 2 bedrooms and we thought that the owner would spend the night in the second room. When somebody opened the apartment door late at night, we thought that he was the owner and on his side, he greeted us as if we were the owners of the place... It was a one-night client for the second airbnb room. That scenario happened almost every day of our 8-nights stay. We think that the owner would have avoided us surprises if he had prepared us about the fact that there would be other airbnb guests in the apartment... - About privacy: were surprised that the door of our room could be locked only from inside, that we had to LEAVE IT UNLOCKED when we were going out. That made us uncomfortable as we want to be sure that no unauthorised person (e.g. those numerous other airbnb clients for the other room) can straight enter our room. We felt that our privacy was not respected enough. We would have liked that each room within the apartment has its own key. I raised the issue with the owner via (Hidden by Airbnb) , asking him how we could do to lock the room, but he didn\\'t answer. We thought that he didn\\'t understand why anybody would bother about privacy issue when he is out of the apartment. - One of the key elements we had insisted on while searching for a room in New York is access to TV. We wanted to be able to catch up with news in the evening after our day out, and in the morning before going out. We didn\\'t want to miss anything regarding US news, UK, EU, Brexit, Russia and, very important, Football World Cup. The listing read: \"Smart TV with Netflix and other On-Demand Channels provided in your bedroom\". Had we known that this was not true,... Lisa and Jonathan\\'s home was the best Airbnb stay we have ever had. \\n\\nThey were incredibly flexible with our changing check in times when my fiancee\\'s flight was late.\\n\\nTheir home is immaculate and so beautiful. The bed is so comfortable.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t use many amenties but they were available. \\n\\nThe price was fantastic for Brooklyn and I would absolutely recommend.

Room was clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated and the hosts were accommodating and quick to answer. Great space and great location! very quick and helpful responses  Very easy and convenient stay. The space was excellent and I would absolutely like to stay here again should the occasion ever arise.  We followed Lisa\\'s advise and went to chill in the backyard while munching on a fresh fruit salad... Just so delightful, her edible garden is a pearl in the middle of all the concrete, a nice breeze was blowing so it was easy to reconnect with my sister who I was visiting for only 24 hours, and time flew without noticing it. The cleaning lady arrived and she was polite and thorough in everything she did so the left the place spotless and smelling fresh. We had an amazing stay, at this very generous little place with a super comfortable bed, everything smelled nice and clean. This really made my trip to NY as it offered the space we needed. I went back to Miami hours later with a happy heart and a smile on my face. Thank you, you guys are doing a great job! Nice deco in the room. The bed is very comfortable.  Cozy, clean, and peaceful room.  Good for a couple.  Did not see the hosts while we were there but they made check-in super easy and were very hospitable.  Very nice place, I can recommended this one It was a very easy check in. The keys were left in a lockbox and the room was amazing. There was another couple staying in another room from France and didnâ\\x80\\x99t speak any English. It really felt like we had our own place though.The area in Brooklyn was amazing, close to trains, bars etc. I highly suggest staying there not too far from the city. Lisa and Jonathan provided the perfect space for us. Would go back again. It was easy and stress free. Back yard was pretty cool too! You will find a comfortable bedroom...great mattress and pillows. lf you want to go into the city you have a convenient subway station nearby..and  you have a great  convenience store right at the subway corner.  As the old saying goes \" Try it.. you\\'ll like it!\"\\n We had a great stay at Lisa and Jonathan\\'s place. The apartment was very clean and comfortable, and we had no difficulty getting there from the subway. The hosts were super nice to us inspite we checking in late the night. Perfect spot with peaceful vibes for an overnight stay, and with reasonable pricing. Would definately reccomend the place. Nice place, comfortable bed.  Wonderfully decorated, relaxing, immaculately clean place to stay. The pillows and bed were some of the most comfy I\\'ve ever seen and it was the best sleep I\\'ve had in months. Could not recommend highly enough! Great place that matched the Airbnb description!

The stay was very lovely and the contact with the hosts made feel assured and welcome. A very comfortable bed and all very clean.

We liked the furniture and art very much, it makes this place special. Mattresses were good, the huge airbed comfortable and the sofas in the living room ok for someone who likes to sleep on harder mattresses.  The kitchen is well equipped with everything you need to fix yourself breakfast, lunch or dinner, luckily there was a dishwasher and enough dishes for two days. Contact with Russ was easy and fast, he was right there when we needed him.\\nIt's a great place to stay if you want a (what I think)  authentic experience of staying in a brownstone in Harlem. It's safe even late at night.  Unfortunately we missed coming to your gallery downstairs, so we definitely want to be back. Thank you!  This home was easily accessible to the Harlem area. Russ was very accommodating and friendly throughout our stay.  This apartment has received many favorable reviews and they have covered all the positives. I have little to add: it is a comfortable and spacious apartment in a lively part of NYC. The hosts are just great; highly responsive to any questions or issues.

       "  \"Nat is super friendly and her place is great to crash. It is a good neighborhood with good coffee places and health food stores which I need  This is an old building with a group of small apartments with a shared kitchen, TV area and tiny bathroom. You go up a steep, creaking stairway to access the rooms. My room was sparse but clean, and the bed was comfortable (though no top sheet was provided, only a comforter). I was excited about this property, and primed to like it when the host, Nat, allowed me to drop off my bags early and get my keys for a late return. Then things went south. When I got back to the apartment, there was no toilet paper... to be found anywhere.. and the bathroom light would turn off and on repeatedly. Taking a shower in alternating light and pitch dark is an experience. The bar of soap in the shower was down to its last one percent. The towel bar fell off at the slightest touch. There were no facial tissues for use in the bathroom or room, which featured no nightstand, no reading lamp, no trash can, no clock.  The window-mounted air conditioner was clackety and held together with duct tape. The wi-fi was problematical. The password provided did not work, and I never was able to connect. So lots of basic amenities that you would expect from any lodging were entirely missing or not working properly. That was very disappointing. Yet things got worse. The building is located on busy Flushing Ave, right at a stop light. Blaring car stereos, revving and roaring hot-rods and bikes cruise by continually (hey, it's Brooklyn), occasionally stopped by the red light, serenading you for a minute of so with their cacophony. Periodically, cop cars and ambulances race by with sirens wailing just below your window. The traffic audio track did not abate until 3am. Then less than a block away, there seems to be either a disco or punk bar (or both) which seem to be operating without a shred of care about the loudness they release into the neighborhood. The Saturday night light show (shooting lasers?) from the disco lit up my room as if were next door.  The bass-heavy music also went on until the wee hours of the night. On the plus side, there is a great little bake shop across the street, the L line is a 10 minute walk away, and I could see a sliver of the Empire State Building from my room. My stay was great! Nat is amazing host and the location was convient (close to L Line for a fast trip to Manhattan). We enjoyed our stay with Nat very much! The room was clean and the welcome was quick and clear. We felt at home immediately and although we didn't see Nat a lot, she was always very helpful and did everything she could to inform us as much as possible. If you need a great place to stay with good connections to the subway, then this is it! This is the perfect cheap + cheerful spot if you are considering a stay in Brooklyn! Nat goes out of her way to make sure you have everything you could possibly need for a carefree holiday. She even baked us chocolate chip cookies! The bedroom has plenty of space, and the private entryway is super convenient. Nat was even sweet enough to help lug my suitcases up the stairs. 5 stars! Great place for the price. L train was extremely close, for the others I had to walk, but didnâ\\x80\\x99t mind it, since that gave me the chance to get to know the neighborhood. Easy to communicate with the host, everything was great!\"),\n",

Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a wine store right next door and grocery store across the street.\\nThe Space: The apartment was perfect for the family! It is clean and tidy. The beds are very comfortable. The couch/living room is comfy but it is a little small for 7 people to hang out so some people hung out at the dining room area which is right next to the living room but honestly we didnâ\\x80\\x99t stay much inside since weâ\\x80\\x99re always out and about.

Weâ\\x80\\x99re blessed to find parking spots right in front of the property and it was during a holiday weekend so we were able to leave our cars for the whole stay. It is downtown Manhattan so it is expected that parking spaces are limited unless youâ\\x80\\x99re willing to pay at least $50/24 hours or move your car every 2 or 3 hours to avoid getting towed. The cops are serious with giving tickets or getting your car towed just fyi. \\n\\nCommunication: Communicating w Aiden is so easy and he is always quick to reply.

A huge mattress or bed box was in the middle of the hallway, as an extra bed or sofa, and the host said it was for us but it was never fixed or installed, partly blocking the way. Taz was quick to answer when we messaged him but admitted himself the place was a mess (seriously ? ). We were told \"it is what it is\" when he sent someone to try to help us with the problems encountered. And the last drop was when we mentioned he needs to call the super to fix the clogged tub we were served the \"oh you know this is New york... \" crap.  I have lived 10 years in NY before, never had such a bad apartment experience.  The person/friend Taz sent to help said himself he was \"useless\" when asked to fix the problems. \\nThe only upside : good bedding (although hard to say if it was clean) and no bedbugs (but some roaches).

Supernice host, perfect location! Great location, central to many amenities and within walking distance of many attractions.  Was not aware that there'd be 5 flights of steps to walk up - no elevator - glad I only had a backpack!  No hairdryer either, but I could live with that.  AC not in the room - a huge fan that was loud.  I did not sleep well.  Sloan was very nice and provided an economical option in Brooklyn! First time choosing a room vs a whole place.   Nice spot and the subway is very close. The airbnb is desribed as having an Ac in French but it is actually a fan. Sloan was very accommodating for the check-in. The ad did state it was on the top floor of a building and there wasn't an elevator. I should have done a little more research and read the reviews that it was 5 flights of stairs. It also didn't have AC and I visited during a heatwave in New York. Most of the year that wouldn't be a problem. It was in a nice neighborhood and close to everything. The price was good! Sloanâ\\x80\\x99s appartement is very well situated and it is really easy to visit both Brooklyn and Manahattan from his place. Very good for alone traveller. I'm only rating 4 stars rather than 5 due to there not being any air conditioning, even though the listing claimed there was. Apart from this a great place to stay. Sloan's place is perfectly located central to everything in Cobble Hill. Great neighbourhood restaurants, bars, coffee shops, Trader Joe's, and easily accessible to the subway station a couple blocks away. I would recommend his place to anyone looking for a great spot to call home for their visit to NYC. Perfect place to stay in Brooklyn if you are traveling alone, clean, nice and comfy, 2 blocks away from subway. It is really safe, I would stay here next time I go back to Bklyn Sloanâ\\x80\\x99s place is fantastic! As a solo traveller staying in Brooklyn for a night to go to a show at the Barclays Centre this place was absolutely perfect. Walking distance from both the arena and the Brooklyn Bridge, this place was affordable and in a perfect location. Will definitely look into staying here again the next time I come to New York. Thanks again Sloan, all the best!  So nice the room! Thanks for Sloan! Bonne expÃ©rience Ã\\xa0 NY, Brooklyn dans un quartier calme et agrÃ©able avec de nombreux bars et petits restaurants.

One thing to note is the bathroom setup is unique - shower is in the hallway with a separate water closet, and a kitchen sink as the only sink on the property.

Affordable and comfortable space close to everything including hospitals, markets and subways. Definitely would book again.     Good sized room, light,  very clean and airy.  A/C is a necessary addition in the summer;\\n I was glad of this.  The room is quiet and pleasant;  the bed is fairly comfortable.  No TV in the room but an old TV in the living room.  Flat kept very clean.  Wi-fi good.  Flat is only about 10 mins walk from Flushing Ave station.  Area felt fairly safe; near hospitals so occasionally heard sirens going off (ambulances)?  Nanie was out most of the time (as I was) so we only met very briefly on my last night. This place was a bit far out from the downtown area for me as I wanted to visit the art museums, but overall it was a good place to stay, a fair price and I would recommend it.

The apartment was perfect for our group of 5 women, everyone slept well and enjoyed the space. We enjoyed our stay! The apartment is perfect for a group of three or more people, with three separate rooms, each with a bed, and a sectional (L-shaped) couch in the living room. It is in a convenient location, within walking distance of little market stores, restaurants, and subway stations. There's a lot of activity in the area, and I always felt safe in the neighborhood, even at night when we'd get back from downtown. In addition to all of this, Kari took every step to make my stay more comfortable and convenient. Since I was driving to New York, Kari blocked a parking spot for me because it would be difficult to find one in the evening, when I was planning to arrive. One of the people staying with me slipped while taking a shower, and ripped the shower liner of the curtain rings as they were falling down. I informed Kari about the incident and was planning to replace the liner, but Kari insisted that I not worry about it. Lastly, Kari offered a place where we could keep our stuff after we checked out.

       "  'Benjamin\\'s place is cosy, comfy, you feel home and can expect calm and good sleep.\\nThe place looks great and Benjamin was very welcoming. Awesome place! Very creative host! Perfect for a quick stop in NY! Easy to get to and pretty good location It was a nice room to stay if you expect to stay with long period of time. It\\'s not the best location if you\\'re going to travel in city like Manhattan. The room is really nice and clean, you might find it bigger than what you thought. :) A lovely spot in Brooklyn, a short walk from the subway. We don\\'t typically Arib&b, particularly in shared apartments, but Benjamin\\'s place was a great experience, and makes visiting NYC affordable and pleasant at the same time. Benjamin was there for whatever we needed, which didn\\'t at all take away from the sense of privacy we had. Also, cool art. Benjamin is an awesome host. He is quick responsive to your question and flexible with your stay. He allowed me to leave my luggage early in the morning and late evening when I checked-out. The whole apartment is decorated by his outstanding art works. \\nHis apartment is on the 4th floor with no elevator (I got 2 heavy luggage and Benjamin kindly helped me lift them upstairs. I can\\'t thank you enough.) and it locates 4 blocks away from J line subway (form/to JFK airport) but can walk within 15 mins. \\nWorth every bucks you spend here! Strongly recommend if you are travelling to NYC. TrÃ¨s belle chambre. Bien dÃ©corÃ© avec une touche artistique de Benjamin. Bien situÃ©, prÃ¨s du mÃ©tro. There is so much I could write. The days we spent at Benjaminâ\\x80\\x99s place were unforgettable. We seemed to click instantaneously and communication was more than relaxed. Even though I have family in NYC, we will definitely try and stay with Benjamin next time weâ\\x80\\x99re there :) <3 A funky place with lots of cool art made by the host. Close to a nice cafe and short walk to the subway. The place was nice! we stayed one night at his place and had everything that we needed for our short stay. AC helped a lot as the apartment is warm. the room was very clean and we have access to the kitchen and living room. subway is on a 10 minute walk, but you can take the bus just 1 block away and connect with the subway. In 30 minutes you are in Manhattan.  This room is the perfect size for a quick getaway for two or a longer stay! We were thankful for the air conditioning as it was so warm. Benjamin is kind, hospitable and responds to messages quickly! Thank you again, Benjamin! We will keep this place in our back pocket if weâ\\x80\\x99re back in the area soon!  Benjaminâ\\x80\\x99s place was exactly what I was looking for. It was clean, centrally located, and easily accessible. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll definitely be staying here again in the future. The place is accurately described, and a definite snooze factory! I had a very comfortable time!  Benjamin gave great instructions to get in, the room was very comfortable. There was plenty of street parking, I was able to park right out front! Benjamin makes you feel comfortabele and at eas. In the middle of Brooklyn it was nice staying. \\nWe loved to sit and play records in the living. Watching all of Benjaminâ\\x80\\x99s drawings and prints at the walls. \\nWe really felt like home because there also was a cat guest. A lovely catâ\\x9d¤ï¸\\x8f\\nThanks for staying at Pulaski !\\n Ben went beyond the expectations communicating with me and making sure by the time we booked his place everything had been answered. His place is cute and accommodating, and the art is fantastic! Thanks again for all you did, Ben!  Benjamin\\'s place in the Bedstuy area is super nice and I highly recommend anyone that\\'s looking for a cute swank place to stay here. The place is within walking distance of the G line and is within walking/cheap Uber distance of a lot of really cool areas, shops, and restaurants. Benjamin himself was a fantastic host - super helpful with checking in and incredibly nice! Room was great - bed is nice, window AC is A+ (super great when dealing with NYC summer weather) and the whole apartment was really nice! Thanks again Benjamin! Benjamin\\'s place was perfect for our stay. We arranged with Ben to drop our bags off a little early so we could get on with our day of exploring. We didn\\'t get to spend much time at the apartment or see Ben as we were out and about, but Ben was really helpful on check in and the room and bathroom were spotlessly clean and very comfortable. We got to explore Bed-Stuy a little - a great little juice and sandwich bar just down the road and a cute Korean restaurant amongst other things. Definitely recommend. Staying at Benjamin was my first Airbnb experience, and I did not regret that I\\'ve choosed him. \\nHe was very helpful, nice and even recommended me some places to go when we met! \\nI\\'m grateful for his hospitality, everything was clean and organised, and the place has an outstanding decor!\\nI would recommend his \"Snooze Factory\" to anyone who is looking for a quiet room in the busy Brooklyn neighbourhood. \\nThank you! Great Cozy space. Great host and lovely artwork to look at throughout the space. Great and reliable host. A genuine and relaxed guy with a warm attitude towards his guests. Checking-in was working well with locker system and we stayed in a roomy bedroom. We felt safe at Benjamin\\'s. Benjamin\\'s place was awesome he was a fantastic host. Very easy going and answered all of our questions. Location is great travel time to Manhattan is about 20min on the subway. Ben\\'s place was amazing. He was super friendly and helpful and made a few of our nights chatting and catching up Cosy room. Stylish space. Host provides plenty of info about finding and entering the property. Simple and easygoing attitude. Clean apartment and all amenities covered. Benjamin is very relaxed and super uncomplicated. The room is nice and the location is pretty interesting. A few lines heading to the centre and the airport, also a metroline connecting brooklyn and queens. Its very handy. If i had to say one thing travellers should be aware of, there were a lot of planes flying over when we stayed there. It didnt bother us, but light sleepers might have some issues with this. Still, i would recommend this place. This place is located in a great location close to subways. I highly recommend taking the subways vs. a cab if travelling around. We got a 7 day unlimited subway pass for approx $33 USD each and it saved us a lot of money. The neighborhood is nice and the neighbors are friendly. Lots of delis located near the apartment which makes it easy to grab breakfast or a late night snack. Benjamin is super friendly and has great tips on the area. His place has a great location with lots of awesome delis around. Apartment has everything you need, from ice trays in the freezer to an AC - critical summer amenities :)'),\n",

I had first called host phone number - left a message but no call came back before customer service solved my problem.\\n\\nThis site has 3 rooms, but only 2 have real doors with locks. I got stuck with a room that presumably was once a small living room with a flimsy wooden accordion door with a padlock on the outside. This room cannot be locked from the inside while you are in it.  [This made me feel unsafe. I spent one night - no choice - cancelled the rest, and got a much better place for the remainder of my NYC stay for only a slightly higher price.] Because one can see through the slots on the door, there was a curtain on the inside of the door. Difficult to close curtains fully (facing another apartment building partly) without blocking the window AC unit. As a location with no host on site, and likely 2 or more strangers as housemates, if that's OK with you, then have at it. It is a cheap price.  The place is funky - I don't mind that - but with the feeling of a host out mostly to maximize profit (i.e., the converted room). There are jury-rigged storage units hanging from the ceiling here and there.  On the positive side, everything I saw was clean -  if a bit cluttered. The kitchen was small, but did seem to have what one needs. Similarly the bathroom, shared with all the other occupants. One guest took a really long time in the one bathroom in the morning, a hazard of such an accommodation. Location not far from the 125th St subway stop, and close to Harlem sites and Columbia Univ.

Thankfully, as soon as we notified the host about the situation, they spoke with the building manager to change construction time for the next day and they accommodated our stay even further. We were very pleased they were able to alleviate the noise situation. I would absolutely recommend this location to a friend of family member!  Wonderful place to use as a base for exploring Brooklyn and beyond. Great for larger groups traveling together. Slept 8 comfortably. Hope to stay again in the future!

We easily walked to Central Park, the Met, and a little further to the Museum of Natural History. The Q train (~3 blocks away) goes directly to Times Square and Broadway in just a few stops. Many restaurants and shops in the immediate vicinity, too. \\n\\nFinally, Helo was extremely welcoming, considerate, and quick to respond to every question we had. We really felt like she went out of her way to make our stay comfortable and convenient. Thanks, Helo, for sharing your home with us.  My family and I stayed in Helo's apartment four days in early August. We did not meet her in person, but the communication was excellent for every request or information. The apartment is two blocks from the subway, with which you can easily reach every part of Manhattan and the rest of the city. There are restaurants and supermarkets nearby, and as for the neighborhood, I can only say one thing: Upper East Side, and those who know a little NYC, know what I'm talking about. The apartment is bright, spacious and very clean, with many carpets and designer furniture, better than it appears in the photos. Recommended.\"),\n",

The space was beautiful particularly the bathroom  big walk in shower with chic tile!  Loved it.  Perfect location 2minute walk to a/c and lots of great restaurants, bars etc all with in a few blocks.  This was one of my favorite Airbnbâ\\x80\\x99s ever!! Quite neighbourhood, walking distance to local bars and food places. Place was very neat and tidy. Bedsheet were clean and smelled fresh. Space is spacious and comfortable. Clean bathroom and had all the basic amenities. I would not think twice before booking this place again. Thanks Olivia for being such an amazing host. Olivia is a warm and welcoming host at her charming house in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant. The private ground-floor apartment is airy, comfortable, quiet, and newly-renovatedâ\\x80\\x94super clean and tidy, with beautiful shining wood floors (thus her request that guests not wear their outdoor shoes in the apartment). Thereâ\\x80\\x99s useful neighborhood information, and some nice guidebooks to the city and to Brooklyn in particular. It was a very sweet home away from home. A perfect cosy apartment in the heart of New York. It was super convenient to use parking spaces and grab the metro which was a short walk away. The apartment was SUPER CLEAN which was greatly appreciated along with the AC perfect in the humid weather!  Oliviaâ\\x80\\x99s prepped her guests for all the things a tourist/visitor would need to know to get by in the neighbourhood with lots of detailed books and guest book. The apartment had all the necessities you need in a home away from home :)  The hostÂ´s place was comfortable and clean with more than enough space for the luggage. After a long (and hot) day in NYC the big and comfortable beds in connection with the TV and the AC helped regaining energy for the next day.  Even thought the neighborhood could be pretty loud at times when you were outside, the inside was always quiet enough to no disturb a good night Â´s  sleep. When there were problems or questions Olivia responded to them pretty quickly and fixed the issues. The surroundings had everything you needed: kiosks, fast food restaurants, bars and a nearby subway station. Great location with an extremely helpful host.

Everything is as showed in the pictures.  The place has a good location to move around NY and Maurice has been really kind and make our holidays easier and greater. When we will be back in NY it will be in this apartment for sure. Very communicative, great local suggestions and the place is a great size. Comfortable beds and everything else you need. Wanneer je naar New York reist, is het appartement van Maurice een absolute aanrader. Schoon, ruim, fantastische bedden en rustig gelegen. Heerlijk is het om vanuit het drukke New York de metro (of de bus) te nemen en in alle rust bij te komen in het appartement. Voorzien van een goede douche, voldoende mogelijkheden om te koken (oven, magnetron, pannen, electrisch fornuis) al is het eenvoudiger (en vaak goedkoper) om bij een take away wat te halen. Maurice zelf is goed bereikbaar en reageert snel op vragen.  \\nWij waren met zijn tweetjes en dat geeft veel comfort.  Met vier personen zal dat comfort er ook nog zijn, voor 6 personen hebben wij onze twijfels. This place is exactly as described. Maurice is a fine host and reacting very swiftly to all messages. Takes some time to Manhattan (20 min by metro), but no matter where you stay, in NY this will happen, depending on what you want to visit ...\\nJust remember it is all open space, no doors between the rooms.\\nBut I will be back some day! Maurice's house was super comfortable!!!\\nIt was clean and the electric appliances were also easy to use (microwave was a bit disappointing because the connection of the outlet was bad). The location was good, I could go to Manhattan in about 30 minutes.\\nAnd what I have to tell you is that host Maurice was a really nice person!\\nYou will never know how much I appreciate it:-)\"),\n",

Clean rooms and hallway, shower got a bit dirty but nothing major. Safe and secure building. The space was great! Our room was a bit hot, but all-in-all definately was worth it! Julia was very good at responding quickly and handling issues. There was a mix up of rooms with another resident; at no fault of the host, and she immediately communicated with them to set up a time to switch to the appropriate room. Would highly recommend, and will be returning! A good place to stay if you plan on being out and about during the day! The subway is a 1 minute walk away. Julia was great!

We had to buy a fan for the room because it was so hot at night (in August). The beds were incredibly uncomfortable and squeeky, and there was hardly any bedding (only a bottom sheet and an unwashed thin blanket, not even a top sheet).

It's spacious and well appointed with full cooking facilities should you feel inclined. Liz was very responsive to a couple of queries  we had during our 9 days. Union square is a nice neighborhood with excellent transport links. Enjoyed my stay at Lizâ\\x80\\x99s place - she is a very thoughtful host who considers everything. Loved the stocked kitchen.

       "  'The apartment is fantastic! Brilliant location and spacious for NYC. Everything we needed for a week in NY in the hot summer. The bed was really comfortable and everything worked really well. Would highly recommend this as a base to explore the villages and the city.  Nice, small and clean flat in a nice neighbourhood with a lot of restaurants nearby. Great location! Super easy access to different subway lines and A LOT of good food!! Foodies canâ\\x80\\x99t miss it! Itâ\\x80\\x99s relatively pretty quite most of the nights given itâ\\x80\\x99s in a popular area. We are very happy to have chosen this location for our stay in the East Village. It was close to all we needed, comfortable, with an easy going  host. Bravo. Are we returning? definitely. The space is small but stylish.  The neighborhood was fun and filled with quirky and interesting stores, restaurants and people.  I would definitely stay there again. Jaimeâ\\x80\\x99s place is lovely.  We had a great time.  He is kind and gracious. A great stay overall! The place location is absolutely amazing for all the cool restaurants and easy access to all parts of NYC. The apartment is well decorated and has the necessary amenities. As for cleanliness, we did find cockroaches but that could be common for NYC (especially if the apartment is close to restaurants). That is something to improve - to have better pest control for the apartment. Other than that, it was a good stay overall! We had a fantastic time staying at Jaimeâ\\x80\\x99s place. My high school son and I where in NY on a college recruitment trip. NYU was easily within walking distance. There is also a YMCA close by for workouts. On our down time we were able to walk to some of the best thrift store/consignment shops. Delicious bagels are two blocks away and several restaurants are within blocks. The apartment is on the first floor but was relatively quiet at night. I would definitely stay again.'),\n",

The place was perfect for us Nice place in Astoria. excellent appartement Ã\\xa0 5 mns Ã\\xa0 pied du metro. quartier calme sans risque le soir. nous sommes arrivÃ©s vers minuit et notre hÃ´te etait la pour nous remettre les clÃ©s. super literie et appartement top Ã\\xa0 l\\'intÃ©rieur. A recommander sans hÃ©siter Great spot  close Al ..  This was the first time my parents have ever used airbnb and I don\\'t think they\\'ll ever go back to hotels. They loved having a full kitchen and refrigerator. The room is very neat and clean and very roomy for a place so close to Manhattan. 10 minute walk from a street with a ton of restaurants and was even able to use ubereats from those restaurants on days we got rained in. The M and R stations aren\\'t very far away and got us to Manhattan pretty quick or to the transfer to the F train to go to flushing. The area had a lot of auto shops and car dealerships so when we walked home at night there wasn\\'t a lot of people and it was very well lit and safe. Best thing was the grocery store a 5 minute walk away. It was the most complete grocery store I have ever been to on a vacation. It had everything you could want in a grocery story. Pretty much a 24 hour Kroger/Albertsons/HEB/Walmart grocery department. This was a lifesaver since we had a 2 year old and had to make multiple trips depending on what she felt like eating or to get snacks. Overall great place and great price. I would stay there again. Kimberly was very accommodating. We needed to adjust our check-in/checkout due to our flights and she worked with us to accommodate to the best of her ability. She also was very quick to respond to any questions we had or anything we needed. The apartment was very clean. There were tons of towels and shampoo/conditioner. Kimberly also provided subway maps for us. It is a great place to stay if you\\'d like to to cook a bit. The grocery store (food bizarre) is conveniently across the street and there are a few pots and pans. The subway is also very close. There was some noise from the neighbors who have kids but it wasn\\'t too bad, and I imagine this happens everywhere. Overall we were very happy with our stay there! We had a great stay at Kimberly\\'s space. It was very clean and cozy. The neighborhood was quiet and so was the building. Both beds were comfortable and being able to take hot baths at the end of rehearsals and performance night a big plus for us. There was plenty of storage/closet space for our things and we were so thrilled that they were flexible with checkout time (thank you btw)! Communication was excellent and easy. It was a quick trip to the theater and our vehicle safe. We even made a request for them not to use heavy cleaning chemicals due to us traveling with two recovered cancer patients and they accommodated us gladly. We\\'ll be recommending this space to our friends and will definitely stay here when we perform in NYC again. Thank you! What excellent hosts you are. Cheers! I highly recommend staying here! So close to the subway, very clean and overall great experience! We WILL be back :) Kimberly\\'s home is in a good location, only takes us no more than 5 minutes to walk to the â\\x80\\x9cFood Bazaarâ\\x80\\x9dsupermarket.\\nYou can buy every kinds of food there. The subway \"Line R\" station is only two blocks away from her home which can takes you to everywhere in New York. We spent 3 wonderful days there, and it left us good memories.'),\n",

Check in was a breeze. \\n\\nDavidâ\\x80\\x99s stylish apartment is extremely clean, cozy, comfortable, free of clutter, and filled with lots of fun and interesting artwork and books to peruse. The WiFi was solid and reliable. The updated kitchen had everything we needed, the bathroom was clean, had a great shower and plenty of hot water.\\n\\nDespite being around the corner from very lively restaurants, bars, and nightlife, the apartment is incredibly quiet. The bed is very comfortable and the air-conditioner in the bedroom kept us cool during the hot and humid August nights.\\n\\nWe canâ\\x80\\x99t rave enough about the location of Davidâ\\x80\\x99s apartment! We loved having Inwood Hill Park just across the street, not to mention Fort Tryon Park and Isham Park, within walking distance. Itâ\\x80\\x99s also just two blocks from the subway A-line and a 25-minute ride to midtown.\\n\\nThe neighborhood is very safe and walkable at night. During one of our evening walks, we were delighted to discover the nearby Inwood Hill Nature Center and only preserved salt marsh in Manhattan. \\n\\nThere is a great bike shop (Tread Bike Shop) located just around the corner, where we rented bikes for two days. In addition to biking the beautiful Inwood Hill Park, the apartment and bike shop are just blocks away from the Henry Hudson Parkway, and minutes to the Little Red Lighthouse and George Washington Bridge. We biked over the GWB to Palisades Park one day and another day we biked the Henry Hudson Parkway all the way to Battery Park, over the Brooklyn Bridge to Brooklyn Heights and then back again to Inwood. It was a great day and a fabulous ride! \\n\\nIn short, we loved our week at Davidâ\\x80\\x99s Inwood apartment and look forward to returning again! Thanks, David! Great stay. Location was wonderful. We were in town to attend a sporting event at  Kraft Field and it was an easy walk in a nice neighborhood. Everything described about the stay was correct. Really easy to get to by subway. There are many nice restaurants nearby and the two parks outside the apartment are beautiful. David is a wonderful host. Quick, easy communication. Check in is a breeze. Everything we needed was available in the apartment. The umbrella he provided was great for our rainy weekend and the morning coffee was an added plus. I don't do well in the heat, and his a/c was awesome. We accidentally locked the keys in the apartment, and David was there on the spot to help us out. Really, above and beyond. I hope to make it back to the area and would definitely want to stay there again! We had a perfect experience at David's place. It was exactly as described and was spotless.  The window air conditioner in the bedroom was a lifesaver at night, too, since there was a horrible heat wave while we were there!  \\n\\nThe location was great! In addition to the gorgeous park across the street, there were plenty of restaurants, stores and easy transportation nearby. David was great at communicating and answered questions immediately when asked. He left great instructions for using the WiFi and the Television (and related services).  \\n\\nWe hope to stay at David's place again in the future when we visit our daughter in Inwood! Davidâ\\x80\\x99s place was absolutely perfect for us. We arrived on a really hot day and the place was cool and clean and so cozy. Itâ\\x80\\x99s right next to the park and great restaurants and the grocery. And really quiet at night! Wonderful Appartement trÃ¨s bien situÃ© Ã\\xa0 2 min Ã\\xa0 pieds du mÃ©tro.

Jestina's place is a great value for a trip to stay in NYC fr a few days. Manhattan is a bit of a subway ride away, but the Flatbush neighborhood in Brooklyn has some great spots and is a short walk from the beautiful Prospect Park.

Allerdings laut und schlafen geht nur mit OhrstÃ¶psel Wonderful space in the center of the Big City.  Easy to get almost anywhere in the city from this location.  The apartment is plenty spacious with an upstairs kitchen, dining and living room space, and bedrooms downstairs.  The beds were quite comfortable with clean and cozy linens.  The bathrooms are small but quite functional with nice shower heads and bathtubs.  \\nI would very much recommend this space for families with children, couples, or anyone wanting a great pad in the city. Clean but very noisy, couldnâ\\x80\\x99t sleep at all to the point we wanted to leave but didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to spend more money on accommodation. The kitchen and bathroom photos do not match apartment and there were way more stairs than indicated. Perhaps more suited to younger people. Nil This was a nice area to stay in NYC. As other reviews have said it does get quite loud, especially on the weekend. Ear plugs were provided though. \\n\\nThe area was spacious inside. There were some issues with lighting and the doors sticking but they were really no big deal in the end. \\n\\nIf you would go in the summertime it could get a bit hot, but for our visit in the fall the AC units in the rooms were plenty. \\n\\nOverall a good place to stay especially if wanting to be near downtown Manhattan!\"),\n",

Location is key and his apartment was exactly what we needed to relax and recharge while venturing out to SoHo and LES. Jacob is super responsive and his apartment/bathroom was very clean and the bed is very comfortable with plenty of pillows which makes for a good nights rest. I would definitely stay here again the next time I am back in NYC. I and my 15 yr old had a great stay at Jake's apartment. The apartment is simple but lovely in one of my favorite areas of NYC, the Lower East Side. The apartment is just down the street from a great art movie house (The Metrograph) and around the corner from classic LES establishments (Kossar's, The Pickle Guys, Doughnut Plant) as well as near the slew of newer restaurants, galleries, coffee shops and more. Jake was hospitable and nice to deal with. He was communicative and quickly responsive. He was also kindly flexible about both our checkin and checkout. I recommend his apartment to anyone looking for an affordable way to spend time in a historic and vibrant NYC neighborhood. I would definitely stay there again. Very good cost/benefit. The place is close to Chinatown and fairly close to Wallstreet and the Brooklyn bridge.  Sparkling clean and very stylish. Jake has an amazing place in a beautiful part of NYC. Had an amazing time My stay at Jake's was perfect for two days in the town. It is close to Soho, Lower East Side and a Subway ride to Brooklyn. Close to the Subway and Chinatown. A great location with an affordable price. The apartment is modern and cool. The room is small but perfect if you are planning to be out and about. The is a nice dinning room area and TV if you want to stay in at night! Jake is nice and considerate, he offered me tips and helped me with what I needed. He even helped me bring my luggage upstairs! Jake was a very helpful host, the apartment was clean and tidy and in a great location. Lots of places to eat nearby and the subway is close too\\n\\n I think u need to check every thing in detail. As he agree us to drop off our luggage early or late before and after we live without exactly time before we order the house.But before the day we need to check out, he told us he only could keep the  luggage until 4pm. What's more, when I ask whetherI can use the restroom when I take the luggage. He said yes but rejected me when i take away my luggage. He directly take out my luggage out of the house by himself which makes me feel disrespect. I don't know whether because we are girls or Chinese This is a chance to experience New York like a New Yorker. Enter the building through two locked doors and don't let the three short flights of stairs frighten you, it is a an easy walk up. Unlock the apartment door and walk into a very pleasant, bright, clean space. Jake is easy to be with and very accommodating. We asked if there was an iron and he bought one the next day. There is lots of 'frig' space for left overs you bring home and a great shower with lots of hot water and plenty of pressure. We would definitely do this again on a return trip. Jake is a great host! Clean and compact - very comfy bed and a great location! Jacob was lovely and really quick to respond to messages. Would stay again! Pros: Jake is friendly and helpful. We were able to drop luggage ahead of check in time and it is a huge relief for visiting New York city. The bedroom and the bathroom are very clean. The place is also close to Chinatown and the subway system.\\nCons: The room is on the 4th floor so be prepared. We are fine with the number of stairs to climb but the smell in the staircase common area does make us feel uncomfortable. I would highly recommend staying with Jake. His place is clean and tidy. The location is ideal. The room is a little smaller then expected however he is a truly amazing person and so very helpful. Thank you for the hospitality\"),\n",

Location is ok as you can see in the map but is a very dark small apartment facing a backyard. There are only two windows giving light to the apartment. One is on the kitchen and the other is in the bathroom. If you are in the the room or on the living room you have to have the lights on during all day and the ceiling fan has to be constantly on to provide some sort of ventilation. Cleanliness is not also a top priority for the host. As the host says she is a very busy woman.  We stayed in the apartment for two periods of one week and our host didnâ\\x80\\x99t clean the apartment or even changed the sheets or towels between the first and the second stay. \\n Great location...great host...convenient location with a comfortable bed and great shower...definitely would stay there again  First time using Airbnb and it was a great experience!

On top of that they even provided phone chargers and a map of New York with the subway lines and highlighted spots of interest. They also recommended several sweet spots and provided travel books. The kitchen was clean and tidy and had everything that I needed to prepare food. And the bathroom was in excellent condition. I would definitely stay here again if I was in Brooklyn. Could not recommend more highly. Comfortable. Good for the price. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t actually meet the host(s) or see much of anyone really. I think there were other guests staying as well as there was some noise in the night. I travel with earplugs so no problem there. If you donâ\\x80\\x99t know New York very well (which I did not) know that this part of Brooklyn is pretty far out there.  Subway stop is really close though and easy to get to. It just takes a while to get to downtown or manhattan. So, figure that into your plans. For the price though itâ\\x80\\x99s a good deal. A good place to crash after a day/evening of adventure.  Had some technical difficulties unlocking the key box and wasnâ\\x80\\x99t able to reach hosts very quickly. Probably operator error on my part. Overall a good stay. Thanks Very easy place to stay, extremely friendly. Very close to transportation to downtown Manhattan Silvia is such a thoughtful guest! She replied pretty quickly when I was late for my check in and I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t get in, and she helped me out with tips about the city, the subway and some shops. Of course the location is quite far from Manhattan but easily reachable by subway. It was a great trip anyway and Iâ\\x80\\x99d come back! Just what I needed for a week in NYC. The manual was very detailed and self check in was easy. The Airbnb was clean and I liked the small touches (local restaurant recommendations in the manual, extra bath towels, roll of TP, small desk for working on computer, night light, etc. ). It was also convenient that this place is a short 3 min walk to the train. My needs were basic as I was out most of the day. I would consider staying again.  the place is pretty good, it's just a little bit dusty and needs to be clean. The place is also near the subway, around 5-7 mins to the subway station, which is nice. Itâ\\x80\\x98s a very good and cheap Airbnb. I stay one week in the Airbnb. Silvias husband checked me in. He were very friendly and helpful. The metro station is very close to the house. Good to know: It takes between 30-40 Minutes to get to the Times Square and Manhattan. You can drive with the metro directly without to change to the Times Square. The bed was comfortable. The neighborhood was not always ok. I feel not everytime save. A lot of people set in front of the shops and look at you or cry loud. You canâ\\x80\\x99t assessment those people in my opinion. \\nThat is the only thing that  I complain. \\n\\nThank you Silvia to stay in your Airbnb! \\n\\nAdrian  The apartment was very good to commute to the city center of NY because the subway station was very close. the subway takes around 35 minutes to commute to the Times Square , the apartment itself was clean, small but comfortable. It was always quiet at night, which was good, and Silvia and her boyfriend were very helpful and kind, they even gave me an umbrella the first night. The only disadvantage was that at night I sometimes felt uncomfortable walking around the neighborhood because there are some shady places and I've not seen a white person at anytime around. Which is okay, I mean I'm not a racist, but I sometimes felt unsafe during nighttime. Nevertheless, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a comfortable stay at an affordable apartment in Brooklyn. This was a clean, spacious room, and a very short walk to the subway. Obviously, itâ\\x80\\x99s a bit of a ride into the rest of the city, so be prepared for that. It was a very comfortable place to stay, and I would recommend it, especially for anyone planning to primarily spend time in Brooklyn.  Great place to stay! Very clean apartment located in Brooklyn close to the subway. You just canâ\\x80\\x99t beat this value for the money. I stayed here for a few days while I worked in Brooklyn.

       "  \"It is conveniently close to the subway. The neighbors are great. \\nIt is not quite as cozy as it looks in the pictures. Love It!. This is a really good place to stay and we really enjoyed.\\n\\nIts less than 10 minutes to the metro. So going to NYC is not an issue.. very easy. \\nDaniel was super attentive the whole time, writing text just to check how are we doing and if we needed anything.  The place has everything we needed and its very ample plenty of rooms and closets and its really clean. \\nThe kitchen is ready to use, has silverware, pots pans, coffee machine, oil, species towels and stuff we needed to make our breakfast. There are also some local grocery stores around to buy your own food. \\nThere is also personal care stuff, like Q-tips, facial tissue,  cotton, make up remover, and all sorts of stuff. Its really well equipped for the guests.\\n\\nI think is only missing a blender, honestly. You cant find a better place and specially a better price. (if you have several people in your party, we were 7 and we were comfortable in the place).\\n\\nOne special note: My wife had forgotten her Jacket, they found it and Daniel agreed to ship it back for me!. He is really a very special host he really deserves his special host award thing from Air Bnb. \\n\\nThere is street parking available close by, but because we stayed several nights we chose a parking garage that it was like ~18 minutes away(walk), I think there is a closer one but more expensive, I got that one from spot hero for $45 for 3 nights. So really cheap considering NY prices.\\n\\nAlso the cleaning lady was nice and charm, we were late for check out but Daniel agreed to let us stay 1 more hour.  So she was fine and she took care of our trash and used towels.\\n\\nIn short would recommend this place to a friend and its likely that I will come visit again.\\n\\nIsrael Absolutely beautiful place. As a first-time airbnb guest (and a new New Yorker), I was nervous that the place would just be the spot to come back to and sleep. But I was wrong, it was so cozy and clean that my guests and I had no problem staying in on a Saturday night! The house is very clean and modern and the rooms were better than we all expected. Clean enough to walk barefoot in thanks to the no-shoes rule. The details were so thoughtful! Daniel provided the bathroom with q-tips, hair ties, mini combs, cotton balls, ear plugs, soap, and umbrellas in the entryway. Not to mention, the house had all the kitchen supplies you would need. The surrounding area had a great selection of fast food joints and convenience stores if you don't feel like going out and spending a lot. Also, the Bronx-Terminal Market...'nuff said! If you're an out-of-stater and you choose this spot, be aware that the surrounding area can seem a bit rough. But once you get to the block where the house is on, the entire vibe changes. I would definitely stay again!  Great place. Cozy, well decorated, and convenient location. Daniel is a great host. Definitely recommend this place. A good place! Nice & spacious place, good location, close to subway. Our host Daniel responded quickly to our question or concerns. When there's an issue, he took it seriously and reacted right away. Ex. The shower drain didn't work well & he sent a plumber the next day to get it fixed. The cons is there is only one bathroom and it's a bit too small for multi travellers. There's no a/c in the room downstairs in front so too hot to sleep. But we knew it already from the house description.  perfect! Logement spacieux et bien Ã©quipÃ© avec nombreux rangements pour un sÃ©jour d'une semaine et correspondant bien Ã\\xa0 la description. Peut-Ãªtre un peu loin du centre aprÃ¨s une longue journÃ©e de marche dans New York mais super bien desservi par le mÃ©tro ; Ã§a compense. Bon rapport qualitÃ©/prix.\"),\n",

Room and bathroom were clean and tidy. 100% recommendable!! Andre cancelled our stay the day we were to arrive. We were on our plane when we were informed we MIGHT NOT have a place to stay. This turned out to be an 11 hour ordeal of being strung along. No contingency plan and hard to reach at times during those 11 hours. Part of that time he was at a wedding but pretty sure not the entire time. We told him we would wash sheets and clean up since he said his guests locked themselves out of apartment. He told us he would call his super and also his neighbor had a key...like I said strung along. We had paid months in advance which allowed him time to let us know he would not be there because of a wedding out of town. Seems very unprofessional and lacking in communication.  He sent a link for a backup plan but there were no availabilities, so these Louisianians (1420 miles from home) parked on the side of the road in the Bronx of N.Y. at 8:30 in the evening to find a place to stay for the next few days. AndrÃ© is a perfect host, we are staying only one night but he was always able to arrange us for our suitcases and our arrival a little early. I recommend it 1000 times and keep this address to return to New York soon. Thank you \\nBtw the appartment is spacious, and the bathroom was clean\"),\n",

Not my favorite family area of NY but still enjoyed it! Everything was as expected. Cool place in the basement of a house. If you drive, know itâ\\x80\\x99s okay to double park during street cleaning as long as you move after. Short ride to manhattan (40 minutes) which is a bit better than other places Iâ\\x80\\x99ve stayed. Close drive to local markets with tons of fresh food and great Caribbean food.  The room is in the basement of a house, but has a private entrance. Very modern and clean.  Subway was close and the place was very clean and modern Unbeatable price for NYC! The apartment itself is cuter than in the pictures, it's very modern, clean, spacious. The location is not the best, but you cant have it all. For the money we paid-it is a great apartment! Will recommend it for sure Amazing place. Less than 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station and the pictures provided in this listing reflect exactly what you'll get, and very clean. The host was friendly and very responsive. Absolutely no issues with our stay. Worth every penny. The space is gorgeous and has everything you need!! It is updated, clean, and just the perfect place to relax after exploring the city. Very easy walk to local subway stop. Finding parking is a bit of a challenge, but if I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t planning on driving I would definitely stay here again!  I had an awesome stay at Jennyâ\\x80\\x99s. The space was clean and modern.   It was a really clean, comfortable and convenient place to stay. It was a 10 minute walk away from the subway station and was nearby to a lot of restaurants and shops. Really enjoyed our stay here!  We have a lovely stay at this beautiful and simple home! This place is great for those who are exploring the city all day and just want to come back to a relaxing home. Public transportation is about a 10 minute walk away. Jenny was more than accommodating! Thank you for a pleasant stay!  Wow, there is a full kitchen to cook meals and stores within walking distance.  Awesome place! Would rebook.

       "  \"This was a great spot for me as it was nice and quiet. The other guests were respectful and Kitty offers a variety of amenities to make your stay very comfortable! I booked this place a few days ago. Then I received a message that the check-in can only be done after 7 PM. This is crazy, but I nonetheless walked around the city with my heavy traveler's backpack. At 7 pm, after not hearing back from the host, I decided to ask if I may at least leave my bag inside the apartment and come back later. The response was that they can only check me in at 11 PM! What??? That is totally ridiculous! What am I supposed to do with my backpack for such a long time??? I then called Airbnb, explained the situation, and they agreed with me that this was something that isn't normal. They tried to get in touch with the host but failed. The host didn't even leave a phone number to be able to speak with her if there are any problems! Also, the listing does NOT have the house number, so I didn't even know where it is! Then, at 11 PM, instead of sending me check in instructions, I didn't receive anything. Later on, the host sent me a message that they are canceling my reservation! So I was left standing in the heavy rain on the streets of New York City with no place to go! How ridiculous!!! Incredible value for the price. However, it seems *airbnb is illegal in new york*. It may explain the weird check-in process. It felt like Kattie made me wait until midnight to make sure I had no way to cancel / report. At that point, she warned me to make sure neighbors do not find out I am in an airbnb. Cozy little studio, super comfy bed, excellent for my one night stay there  It worth exactly as much as I paid.\\nService, care, responsibility... don't expect that because it is cheap\\nEx) no cooking . no breakfast . no towel change . narrow space. dirty restroom . broken stuffs\\nIf you just need place only for sleeping it's not too bad. But I recommend you to get water from starbucks, use restroom in starbucks near her room.\\nI'm just giving you objective opinion about this room but subjectively, I really don't like this check-in system which makes people wait a lot as well as requires bunch of things even though they are exactly on time. Check-in was awful. I was asked to meet at 11 pm in front of a Starbucks that closed at 10:30 pm. I told Kitty that I wouldn't have internet on my phone, if there was no WiFi, but that I would definitely be at the meeting point on time. Still, at 11:20 pm, nobody had came to pick me up. I finally checked-in, around midnight, and after Â« agreeing Â» to a bunch of rules that weren't mentioned in the add. Basically, the flat is kind of a disguised hostel, and I was asked to lie about where and with whom I was staying, if asked by the neighbors. The apartment door was to stay unlocked at all times. I didn't feel very safe. There were several beds in a small room, and drapes were drawn all around them, so there was no way to tell how many people were there, and who these people were. I left the next day. Kitty's place was such a great find, perfect for solo travelers or for anyone spending a few days in the city. She provided many great amenities in both the bathroom and common kitchen area. The bed was ridiculously comfortable as well. The common shared room area was filled with little trinkets and fairy lights that made the stay very special. I would definitely stay here again. :) \"),\n",

Would recommend as a pretty solid option, Jennifer is communicative and her space is nice. You donâ\\x80\\x99t get a lot, but the bed is solid sized and the AC worked fantastic, which are pretty much my requirements for any airbnb. She is right that although the apartment building seems old, the apartment itself is very modern and nice. She was very nice and gave all the information I need right at the beginning. I only stayed for a night but it was a relaxing night. Basic appartment and very small and simple room- it's quite tight with two people with luggage and all, very little space to move around. But the bed is comfortable, it's quiet and the location is excellent, great neighborhood. Jenn was super nice and her cat is amazing and gorgeous. We didnâ\\x80\\x99t like the bed and I donâ\\x80\\x99t think it was cleaned. The bathroom wasnâ\\x80\\x99t clean and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know about the sheets on the bed either. I wiped the dresser and bedroom floor down and it was very, very dirty. Squeaky bed. Great AC. Good location if youâ\\x80\\x99re into east village.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s small but itâ\\x80\\x99s whatâ\\x80\\x99s offered, I think it mightâ\\x80\\x99ve been just a rushed period when I stayed, so it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t throughly cleaned. I think overpriced for what I paid. So this place was in a great location, very clean, the only issue was the cat. Literally all night long the cat meowed and scratched at the door the entire time. We were not able to get any sleep, the poor thing was so stressed out that we were there. Finally at 6am it was quiet and went to sleep and we were able to go back to bed ourselves. We knew before hand that there would be a cat but never could have imagined how loud and unrelenting it would be. We felt bad for the poor thing and had know idea of how to calm it down.\"),\n",

Sin embargo Brooklyn es tan bonito y tiene tanto que ofrecer que se puede aprovechar justo en esos dÃ\\xadas para conocerlo.\\nNosotros buscÃ¡bamos conocer un New York mÃ¡s de verdad no sÃ³lo quedarnos con las fotos de las pelÃ\\xadculas y en ese sentido esta ubicaciÃ³n te ofrece esa otra vista de la ciudad, ves los autobuses del colegio pasar, la gente ir y volver del trabajo y descansar el fin de semana.. y no nos importaba tener que coger el metro 40 minutos para llegar a Manhattan. \\nHemos pasado unos dÃ\\xadas formidables aquÃ\\xad y recomendamos el apartamento. Eva's apartment is very aesthetically done up with all the modern amenities you'll need. I picked it because it didn't have TV! (who wants to be tempted into being a couch potato when in New York). The C and A train combo gets you to Manhattan in 25 minutes so if felt like I had the best of both worlds. The beds are comfortable and there's even a back porch where guests can sit and enjoy the outdoor feel. Eva is super responsive and looks out for her guests. Highly recommended\"),\n",

Good experience and quickly response from household We rented a 3BD unit for our family. One day prior to arrival, the owner told us the unit was unavailable because of a floor repair. Instead we were given a 2BD + an adjoining 1BD on a higher floor. This would have been OK since we were all adults, but neither our key nor the housekeeper's key could unlock the door to the 1BD. After several hours, a building supervisor came and was able to unlock the door, but we later locked ourselves out again, and he had to come back to let us in. The owner was responsive and had the lock fixed the next day. None of the TV's worked despite our following the owner's suggestions about HDMI. The owner suggested the previous tennant might have modified the TV's for gaming. After several hours of fiddling with the remotes, we finally got the cable tv turned on. The TV in the bedroom of the 1BD never did work. The main TV in the 2BD had a soundbar which was not connected, and we were unable to connect it because no connecting cable was provided. Other than these problems, we enjoyed the condition of the units, the views, the exercise room, and the skylounge. The owner was responsive through the airbnb message site, but we wished he could have been in town to help us solve the cable tv issues, since the housekeeper told us she couldn't help with that. \\n \\n \\n   Good location in Hellâ\\x80\\x99s Kitchen with great views from the apartment.

Bellissima vista sulla cittÃ\\xa0 essendo al 44 piano!  Apartment was clean and the view was gorgeous. It was easy to communicate with host and easy check-in. Beds were comfortable. Our stay in Michael's place was fantastic! I was a bit nervous as I had reserved the place 7 months before our trip and then went back just before we left and saw the reviews about staying in a different unit than the one which was originally reserved. I reached out to Michael via text a few days before our arrival and he was prompt in responding to me and was able to address all our questions leaving us feeling great again about our choice. We were a family of 4 traveling with my cousin and her family of 3. The two family's were originally to stay in one 3 bedroom unit, but as that was not available due to a necessary renovation, we stayed in Michael's two separate units in the same building. They are literally right next door to each other so we still felt like we were traveling together.  It turned out perfectly for us. \\nThe building is amazing. City views, River views, secure, clean, quiet, convenient to get everywhere we wanted to go. We quickly got to Mid Town, Lower East side, Chinatown, Central park and even found it an easy commute to the NJ airport. There is parking in the building, but it's a service, not a self park so be prepared to pay ten bucks for in and out service during your stay. \\nThe check in and out process is SO easy with the use of your cell phone! Micheal gave us great information about the home as well as the surrounding areas including restaurants and attractions. Kitchen has plenty of service ware such as plates, bowls and cups. The pots and pans are adequate for small meals.  The bed was a sleep by number and we were all very comfortable. I am picky about my bed linens and these were deliciously soft and the extra pillow and comforters were lovely.  We also appreciated having the extra towels- as our teens use more than one.  We also LOVED having the laundry in the apartment! It was rainy and we could just pop our kids sweatshirts in the dryer for a few minutes upon returning from our outing. \\nThe grocery on the corner has prepared meals as well as a lovely assortment of organic produce. One of our highlights was enjoying the art as we walked the Highline park and then easily strolled back to Michael's. The amenities of the building and location of this home were truly incredible! No one in my family was ready to leave and would jump at the chance to stay here again. Great view from the rooms and good location with 15 min walking distance to subway. \\n\\nIt is not convenient to drop off and pick up luggage as no luggage is allowed at the lobby.\"),\n",

Overall We had a great time staying at Robs place. He was a very good communicator and quick to respond to any questions. Very good location, apartment was clean. Great place! Amazing location. Super clean and exactly what we needed. My friends and I had a wonderful stay at Robs BnB, from the get go he was very clear with instructions on check in and how to use everything. \\nThe location was great only 5 mins to local subway stops and many cafes. Perfect mid town location to get to all of manhattan and even Brooklyn. \\nRob was incredibly prompt with responses to our messages when we required anything. \\nBeds were super comfortable and the place was clean and tidy! \\nThanks for a great stay. æ¸\\x85æ½\\x94æ\\x84\\x9fã\\x81\\x8cã\\x81\\x82ã\\x81£ã\\x81¦ï½±ï¾\\x92ï¾\\x86ï¾\\x83ï½¨ã\\x82\\x82ã\\x81»ã\\x81\\x86ã\\x81µã\\x81\\x9fè±\\x8aå¯\\x8cã\\x81\\xa0ã\\x81£ã\\x81\\x9fï½¡robã\\x81®ï¾\\x9aï½½ï¾\\x8eï¾\\x9fï¾\\x9dï½½ã\\x82\\x82æ\\x97©ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81\\x8bã\\x82\\x89ã\\x81¨ã\\x81«ã\\x81\\x8bã\\x81\\x8få\\x8a©ã\\x81\\x8bã\\x81£ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x81\\x97ï½¤ä½\\x95ã\\x82\\x88ã\\x82\\x8aã\\x82\\x8aç«\\x8bå\\x9c°ã\\x81\\x8cç´\\xa0æ\\x99´ã\\x82\\x89ã\\x81\\x97ã\\x81\\x84!é§\\x85ã\\x82\\x82è¿\\x91ã\\x81\\x84ã\\x81\\x97ï½½ï½°ï¾\\x8aï¾\\x9fï½°ã\\x82\\x82è¿\\x91ã\\x81\\x8fã\\x81«ã\\x81\\x82ã\\x81£ã\\x81\\x9fã\\x81\\x8bã\\x82\\x89å\\x8a©ã\\x81\\x8bã\\x81£ã\\x81\\x9f!

       "  'We stayed at Adam and Melâ\\x80\\x99s place for about two and a half months. The apartment is just wonderful! It is spacious and gives you plenty of room to store your belongings, especially when you are visiting for a longer time, like we did. The main room divides into the kitchen and dinner area and a corner with the couch, the television and an exercise bike. This gave us enough space to host a friend who was visiting from home. Also, the bike, dumbbells and yoga mats provide an opportunity to exercise at home if you are not in the mood to go running in Prospect Park, which is just five minutes away. And last not least there is the fully equipped kitchen with all kinds of pots, pans, knives, utensils etc. to prepare a five course dinner if you want to :D During summer we got to enjoy the air condition, but there is also a nice breeze if you open all of the windows. We always felt really at home in the apartment! In the neighbourhood there are plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants. And if you are heading out to Manhattan, you can choose between the 2, 3, 4, 5, B, Q and C train which are all within walking distance and take you to about any place in Manhattan without having to change. The way to the C train may seem a bit sketchy at night but I guess in reality it is not and you can always take the shuttle train there or even the bus, which stops right in front of the building entrance. Also, it is a really short ride to the Coney Island beaches and you can get to JFK in about one hour. Adam and Mel are great hosts and probably the kindest persons you can find out there on airbnb! They replied instantly to our request and after a short chat they confirmed our booking and everything went really smooth! A couple of days before our arrival they provided us with detailed instructions on how to get the keys and emergency contacts should we not be able to get them. But we got in without any problems and found a personal note and a bottle of wine as welcome gift there, which we found very kind :D They had given us enough information to get settled there and later that week we hopped on a video chat with them to get some more information and answer some questions. Adam and Mel were really helpful the whole time, for instance when I was having trouble with the wifi on my old computer Adam fixed it right away. The same he did when we wanted to move out earlier, he even called airbnb to arrange that for us! Lastly I can confirm that Adams description of the apartment and the neighbourhood is accurate in every aspect. We really enjoyed our stay there and would love to stay there again if we ever...'),\n",

En si todo estÃ¡ perfecto, gracias Sarah. :) Ã\\x93timo custo beneficio para quem quer se hospedar em Manhattan! A small, but functional Manhattan apartment. Quiet room off the main road. Clean and air conditioned. Sarah and her partner are very nice, though they are not much around the apartment. We met her partner because something went wrong with our key, but it would be quite possible to never meet either of them, given the key cafe system (I could see this as a pro or con depending on who you are). I would stay here again if I needed to be based in Manhattan.  Sarah's place was great!! There were two problems I encountered while staying here. The window unit above ours dripped onto ours making a loud tapping sound which made falling asleep a little difficult. Then we went 2 days without clean towels. It was very hot so we were very sweaty every day. Other than that it was a great stay and I recommend staying here. Sarah's apartment is perfectly in between all the best spots!! Clean, quiet, and cozy!  Small apartment but location is perfect. Good to stay for a couple days! Appartamento molto pulito e ben localizzato (la metro Ã¨ a pochi isolati). Il quartiere Ã¨ tranquillo ma con parecchi bar e ristoranti dove poter passare la serata. La procedura della consegna delle chiavi Ã¨ molto pratica e non richiede la presenza Dell host (Ã¨ possibile arrivare a qualsiasi ora).  Super :-) appartement bien situÃ© trÃ¨s propre \\nLa ligne de metro permet vraiment d'aller partout \\n Great location. Good place. It's a really small place but good for sleeping and shower. Tons of restaurants and bars around. Perfect timing and instructions for keys, adress and other details The apartment was in a great location and Sarah was very helpful and communicated very well and quickly. It is close to bars, restaurants and the subway. The only issue really we experienced was that another tenant in the apartment had a dog who was distressed and barked and scratched all night, so we lost out on a lot of much needed sleep. But this was addressed with Sarah and I believe dealt with. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why Sarah is called a â\\x80\\x9csuper hostâ\\x80\\x9d. She wasnâ\\x80\\x99t there at all, in fact all 3 rooms in her apartment are let out via air b&b which I believe goes against the rules for New York. She was totally unresponsive when I arrived and my check in experience was incredibly stressful. I texted her several times as I was unable to open the apartment door with the keys but she didnâ\\x80\\x99t respond. She never contacted me afterwards either to see if I was okay. I was angry and upset about this. \\n\\nHer actual apartment room is very small but clean. The shower is weird and gets too hot suddenly, it scalded me on one occasion. Otherwise the space was fit for purpose. \\n\\nSarah has lots of house rules but she needs to realise that if she gives the impression that she will be there to act as a host that is what is expected. I brought her a gift from Ireland. I gave it to the other air b&b guest. Overall Iâ\\x80\\x99m disappointed. comfortable, small, safe room with AC in a great spot in the city Great location and Sarah really helped us with the keys during check in! No complaints at all, both myself and travelling companion loved every part of our stay - especially the comfy pillows! Sarah is also lovely with quick responses on message. Room was tiny, STRONG musty odor in the bathroom that induced nausea in me, three sets of doors with difficult locks to get to your room....

       "  \"Jacob's place is lovely and in a great location!  Quiet building, excellent location. We stayed as a group of 6 adults in Jacobs place and had the entire apartment. A couple of things to note, before even arriving Jacob contacted me to let me know a friend of his Erick would be checking us in as he would be away. We arrived at the address provided only to be told by the lady working at the apartment building that there was no one living at the apartment under either of those names and someone had been giving this address to air bnb customers as a pick up point. At this stage I contacted Erick who told me to walk further down the street to get to the apartment and gave the PROPER address. We get into the apartment and Erick tells us that the reason that we were given an incorrect address was that air bnb is not allowed in the building and is illegal in NYC without a resident also staying at the place. Erick also tells us he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have enough towels for all of us but will be back later that night to bring more. We did not have enough towels until 2 days later, with multiple phone calls and texts to both Jacob and Erick. Water leaking in one of the bathrooms, coming down the walls and flooding the floor. Air con was also an issue with it being in one bedroom only with the other unit covered in mould. Photos were an appropriate representation of the apartment, although bedrooms are much smaller than they seem. Location was good (close to 911 memorial and downtown shopping) and conveniently located near Fulton st subway station. Unfortunately with all of the other issues we had whilst staying I would not recommend this place. Absolutly best location!! Clean and nice appartment with very nice bathrooms.\"),\n",

You get what you pay for and if you have a few hours layover or just need a bed for the night this place is convenient and affordable. Like the owner says definitely bring your own sheets, pillows, towels etc. I would also recommend bringing your own earbuds, eye mask for sleeping plus make sure you have the entrance code instructions before you get there. Since you could share the space with long and short term guests that dont follow the house noise and cleaning rules so be ready for it.

It worked for our group of 8 women.  However, we were surprised to find only 1 twin bed when it was listed as \"twin beds\". We came with a group of 8 and had anticipated using all 8 beds without adding the couch. I\\'ve marked my score down because of this.\\n\\n* explain the layout of the bedrooms. It worked for our group of women, but it might be a difficult arrangement if there were couples.  The home was perfect and my family of seven truly appreciated everything.  The air conditioners worked very well through the heat wave we had during the week there. The rooms were spacious and we loved being so close to the Ferry to go back and forth into Manhattan. Excellent value for large home easily accessible to Manhattan with a driveway to protect your rental car as well. House is unique & close to ferry We had a wonderful experience in this beautiful home. \\n\\nVery spacious, safe and comfortable space. \\n\\nCooking pans and coffee mugs were lacking in cleanliness and numbers but we managed with throw away aluminum pans.\\n\\nExtraordinary value compared to staying in a hotel in the city. \\n\\nThere were other guests in other parts of the home, but didnâ\\x80\\x99t even realize it until we were all leaving for the day. \\n\\nNatalia was kind and responsive to communications.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this home. \\n great place,very convinient,quiet neighborhood .thanks to Natalia for her beautiful and nice place where we stayed for few days,hope will come back soon. What a great place!!!  I absolutely loved to architecture and way the house was decorated.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s a quick five minute drive to the Staten Island Ferry.  We stayed for four nights and loved having a home to come back to.  Love love love!!! The appartment is indeed a historic gem. When you enter the rooms you enter another fantastic world. There is sufficient space, ceiling vents and air condition in all rooms. It is a 30 minutes walk to Staten Island Ferry but you can also take the bus or a taxi (ca. 12 $). Shops and restaurants are just some steps away. We highly enjoyed it and we can imagine that you will. Natalia messaged a few hours prior to check in with all of the house details, which was helpful. It was very simple to access the key with the code she provided. The house is so spacious and comfortable-especially the beds! It is on a beautiful block with plenty of parking. We just stayed one night and had a lovely time. House with lots of character.  Close to Staten Island Ferry, lots of ride sharing options, we used Lyft for all our needs. Natalia\\'s place was in an excellent location, quiet street, private parking and safe area.  However, when we arrived to check-in, the host was uncontactable on the phone number provided, despite leaving numerous messages.  We waited for over 1.5 hours to be let in, and it was only the housekeeper who happened to be visiting the next door neighbours who saw us at the front door and let us in.  Once we were in, the host did contact us to give us the combination to the key-lock outside.  Our 4 available beds soon turned to 2, as two of them were \"unsleep-able\" - one was so rock hard it was like lying on the floor and the other one was only marginally softer than that.  We ended up pairing up and sleeping two in the king bed, and two in the full bed - not ideal really for three sisters and a teenage nephew.  Used towels from the previous guests were in the hamper, and all the crockery and cutlery were in the dishwasher - and minimal supply of both.  We thought we had rented the entire house, but after our first night a group of people arrived, and stayed on the top floor.  We were able to lock doors leading to our \"part\" of the house though.  Overall we had a good stay and my Australian family loved seeing the squirrels outside everyday! 6 of us stayed for two nights, the house is immaculately kept the historic style. Beds were comfortable, the showers were nice. Very clean space! Super spacious, great dining room table to play tabletop games on. Huge living room.  The neighborhood was very quite, as was the house at night. Would definitely come again!!! excellent emplacement, accÃ¨s aux ferry rapide en voiture, maison calme, adaptÃ©e pour 7 personnes.\\nexcellente rÃ©activitÃ© de l\\'hÃ´tesse en cas de besoin.

The back patio was a great touch and so relaxing . The place was great, nice and clean. same as shown at  the pictures.\\nVery comfortable and cozy. Nous avons beaucoup aimÃ© lâ\\x80\\x99endroit. Beaucoup dâ\\x80\\x99espace pour notre petite famille. Bien situÃ©, propre et joli! Jâ\\x80\\x99y retournerais sans hÃ©siter! Great apartment, centrally located to explore all the spots in nyc. Nikki was an excellent host. Would go back again. The place itself was great, but I will not stay here again mostly because of the host.  First, the place had no free parking on the premise; this amenity was a major reason why we chose this place.  The host even failed to tell us (I don't know if intentionally or unintentionally) until on the day of our travel, even after I specifically asked about how to park at the place, so we were not happy.  Second, communication from the host was not timely and not sincere. The host's reply missed the critical info (such as the combo for the key lockbox),  and I had to ask multiple times on the day of our travel.    We enjoyed our stay - the apartment has been nicely updated and is in a great location for accessing restaurants, groceries, etc. We appreciated the king size bed, which isn't common in NYC. Apartment had a well-stocked kitchen and included thoughtful touches like toothbrushes (in case you forgot one) and a manual with Manhattan highlights. Check-in and check-out were easy via lockbox. Hosts were very accommodating at checkout letting us stay a couple of extra hours after we had a flight cancellation and needed to come up with a new plan. As others had mentioned there were ants, but you're on the ground floor in NYC so it's to be expected. Our only real hiccup with the stay was that the description listed free parking on the premises as an amenity. This isn't the case which was disappointing. We were able to find free street parking a couple of nights, but needed to pay additional fees for garage parking on others. Just something to be aware of if you will have a vehicle. Overall we had a great stay and would recommend this apartment.  Excellent location! Communication was poor and some minor cleanliness issues. With that said, Iâ\\x80\\x99d recommend this air b&b.  This place can realistically sleep 2 in the queen bed. Air mattress deflates throughout the night and the couch does not pull out into a bed. Host promised a second key but did not communicate nor deliver in this regard. Good location. This was a wonderful place to stay in New York! We especially loved the patio and the location. The place is very comfortable and clean. We didn't spend too much time in the place but the bed was very comfortable and a great place to rest in at night. We also stayed during peak summer heat so the AC and the Brita water pitcher in the  fridge were very much appreciated.\\n\\nWe also loved loved the location. It's a short walk from the subway and a ton of sightseeing spots. There's also a couple great bars and restaurants in the neighborhood worth checking out.\\n\\nHighly recommend this place if you're on a 2 person trip and if it's within your budget! Location is prime , you can walk everywhere . Slow response from host , listing is false as it shows free parking on premise which the day of check in they tell you to check out an app so you can pay parking. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not like a discounted parking where the host pays a portion itâ\\x80\\x99s just a regular website for premium garage parking. If you donâ\\x80\\x99t have a car stay here but there are less expensive places in New York. Hotel next time Forsure. We stayed in the apartment for 3 nights. Upon arrival, we immediately realized that the apartment is a lot older and dirtier than advertised in the pictures. Furthermore, there were also ants everywhere. On he other hand, It was great to have daily check ups from Niki to make sure everything was going well and the cleaners were also extremely nice and accommodating.  Carlitos place was an amazing location, a few blocks away from major attractions yet somehow it felt private, quite and just like a home away from home.  The little touches in the house really pleased me and having a back patio to enjoy some privacy with friends was amazing. Highly recommend staying here and I know Iâ\\x80\\x99ll definitely be back!  Fantastic place, super clean, fast Wi-Fi,  Roku on TV.  The private backyard is great. Awesome stay My stay here was fantastic! It is centrally located. Convenient store at the corner, but of course I didn't need anything since Niki provided all the amenities. The space was large, much larger than I expected. AC worked and cooled the apartment well. Bed was comfortable and provided a good quality of sleep. I was able to draw the curtains so at night it was pitch black and noise was non existent and super quiet. The place was sparkling clean, fridge had a Brita and creamer for coffee, of course a coffee machine and offers as well. She had a book with all the local offerings of food and shopping as well. It even gave me some history of the hosts which was a nice touch. The best part was the patio, it was actually a private (non-shared) patio that no one has access to. You aren't next to any neighboring patios, just your own patio with seating outside. I didn't know what to expect, but it blew me away.\\n\\nThank you for being such a great host and I will definitely be staying with Niki again! Absolutely great area which allowed us to see a lot of the city with ease! Clean space and very responsive host! Niki's place is really nice. The best thing is the king size bed, which is extremely comfortable.  It's a good location if you like walking. About 10 minute walk to the Empire State. We stayed for ten days and the weather was terrible, so we had to spend some time in the apartment. The dining area is not very comfortable and there are a few things here and there that are in no way a deal breaker and I'm sure will get fixed shortly.  There is a Fairway on 2nd and 30th, which took us a while to find so I thought it might help others to point it out. The neighborhood is nice and there are a few little nice places to go have something to eat and drink down the street. I would recommend this place in general.\"),\n",

       "  \"Great place !  Perfect location and easy walk from the subway.  Wenting is a Great host. I was searching a room for a very good friend of mine who was visiting from Japan for six days. We thought we had found it when we booked Wintings room. My friend ultimately did not end up staying there however. Therefore I can only comment and review and two things the area and my interaction with Winting. Through a series of text, Wenting proved to be inaccurate, unkind, irrational, baffling, condescending, and overall inhospitable. What shouldâ\\x80\\x99ve been a simple stay, became a nightmare and one of the worst Airbnb experiences both myself and Migusa have experienced. I want to break down specifically and exactly what happened so that this unfortunate situation can be avoided as best as possible for others. I asked (4) questions the day before arrival, on the behalf of my friend Migusa. These were four simple questions. 1.) Is there an AC in the room? 2.) Is there a freezer she can use? 3.) Would an hour early check-in be possible? 4.) if early check-in is not possible... Would she be able to drop her bags off an hour early until check in? We received a reply shortly after from Winting stating â\\x80\\x9cThere is an ac installed in the room and a fridge in the kitchen. There is a guest checking out just before your friend, so I will need time to clean the room and get it ready, 2pm check in should be expected but if anyh unfortunately happens early than that I will keep you posted.â\\x80\\x9d I was happy to receive a timely reply but noticed two important questions had not been answered 1.) if there was a freezer my friend could use (she was bringing some important things that needed to be frozen) 2.) since early check-in wasnâ\\x80\\x99t an option would she simply be able to drop off her bags so she wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have to carry them around with her the hour before check-in? This is where the issues initiated. Although I had immediately written back to Winting to follow up on the two questions that were not answered we never received a reply, one hour went by, then two hours, my friend would be departing her home soon and really was hoping to get an answer, so I resubmitted the questions in hopes that maybe she just missed it. Yet another 3 1/2 hours went by, finally after my friend had already left home to travel to NYC and 6 hours later, I sent a text to Wintings phone, in hopes to finally get the answer to the two questions. When she finally did reply which was almost 7 hours after I initially inquired, she did not give an answer to the 2 questions, rather she showed contempt, hostility, and said that she canâ\\x80\\x99t be by her phone at all times, she said she had already answered the questions and Migusa cannot check in early. It was extremely baffling and inhospitable, plus a bit rude because it never answered the original 2... The room is really comfortable with the air conditionner. The entry is separatly wich is perfect to be free. We really enjoy the district which might be discovered, specialy if you like street art. \\nMany things to do around and a good long walk by Williamsburg bridge to cross Manhattan.

Super communication and the a/c unit was a life saver.   Wenting was quick to respond, greatly accommodating, and overall wonderful! Apartment is on a busy street, but she provides earplugs if youâ\\x80\\x99re sensitive to the nighttime soundtrack of city noises.  Amazing stay at Wentingâ\\x80\\x99s place. Perfect place and close to lots of things to do in Brooklyn. Our plans changed a few times and Wenting was more than accommodating and amazing at communicating with me through out the entire booking process. We will definitely be checking her availability for our next trip to Brooklyn. 100% recommend:)  Great location and a beautiful room.  Hot during the summer, but still comfortable (what historical Brooklyn building has central AC?).  Close to the L and walking distance to great restaurants and bars.  Highly recommend.  This was a great place to stay in Brooklyn. Very close to the L train to Manhattan. Lot's of cool bars/coffee shops/shops in the area. It was all very charming and I would definitely stay there again. Wentingâ\\x80\\x99s home was wonderful! Just as shown on the profile. It was in a great location in Brooklyn!

       "  'My fiancee and I had a fantastic week in Jason and Ondine\\'s place! We dealt mostly with Ondine and she was very pleasant and helpful but also gave us plenty of space to just come and go on our own, which was exactly what we wanted.\\n\\nThe apartment was perfect for us - up a couple flights of stairs, but that was no problem for us and Ondine even insisted on helping us with our luggage. The bedroom was cozy and *very* conducive to good sleep. Nice sitting room for us to make our \"base camp\" and a good, clean bathroom. The shower is a little awkward because of its location under the peak of the roof and because my fiancee and I are both pretty tall, but we made it work just fine. The BEST, most wonderful thing during our stay was the AIR CONDITIONING. It was a heat wave pretty much the whole time we were out there and without AC we would\\'ve been miserable. The windowbox air conditioners in the bedroom and the sitting room were fantastic and cooled the place down within minutes of our return every day. Seriously - they were a godsend.\\n\\nThe only hesitation I\\'d have staying here in the future would be that most of our time was spent in Manhattan and Staten Island wasn\\'t the most convenient location for that. Going in and back once a day was fine - the ferry is fun and reliable and free - but if we wanted to go to the city for the day and then come back and change before going back in at night, it ate up a lot of time. BUT that\\'s why the rates here are so much more reasonable than staying in Manhattan, and that was a priority for us, so this was the right way to go.\\n\\nIn summary, this was pretty much a perfect situation for us - a whole floor of a nice house to ourselves, really pleasant and helpful hosts, at a great rate. If that\\'s what you\\'re looking for, I highly recommend booking here! I bet we\\'ll be back some day. :) fantastic place to stay, we loved our stay ã\\x81¨ã\\x81¦ã\\x82\\x82é\\x9d\\x99ã\\x81\\x8bã\\x81§ï½¤ç·\\x91ã\\x81\\x82ã\\x81µã\\x82\\x8cã\\x82\\x8bç\\x92°å¢\\x83ã\\x81§ã\\x81\\x99ï½¡ Fantastic hosts! Dine was amazing with handy tips and advice on what to do! Exceptional service and apartment. Had everything you could possibly need. So very thoughtful! Would definitely reccommend.  The apartmentis fantastic.  Jason and Dine were wonderful hosts. Our flight was delayed and we arrived at Jason and Dine\\'s home about 03:30 am and could check in smoothly using the keypad and the clear instructions they had given us. The place was clean and had everything you need in the kitchen and bathroom. The bedroom was clean and fresh. We didn\\'t get to meet Jason but Dine was very friendly and helpful. She gave us great tips and was very keen to help. We felt both comfortable and safe if their home.  A beautiful apartment 10 mins walk from the Ferry terminal. Very quiet. Very comfortable and amazingly well equipped. The hosts are so welcoming with lots of local knowledge and so helpful. \\nNo 1 place to stay if visiting New York.  The loveliest hosts you could hope for and a great space! Very private but always available to chat if needed, super friendly and helpful. Nice touches like leaving some food and beer. Very clean and cozy apartment, very comfy bed, yes the shower is tiny but perfectly good if youâ\\x80\\x99re not tall! Air con was great and a lifesaver! Quick and easy walk to the ferry, a short commute into the city by NYC standards, 24/7 and free! If you time it right you could go from front door to the city in 35/40 mins! Would definitely stay again, a great experience! Really nice place about 10 minutes from Staten Island ferry. Everything laid on from food to towels. Super clean apartment with a good personality. Jason and Dine gave great indications on the local amenities and really quick responses to any questions I had. As a bonus, you get to see the Manhattan skyline and Statue of Liberty twice a day on the ferry. We had a great stay with Dine and Jayson who were the most wonderful hosts we could have wished for. Both were very helpful with any kind of request and besides really cool people to talk to. Both are graphic designers, and you can see their sense of beauty everywhere about the beautiful historical woodframe house. There where so many lovely details like fresh flowers in the bathroom or the fluffiest soft towels I have ever seen. The flat is very tastefully decorated, a very nice place where we really felt at home. The bed was wonderfully soft and cosy. Dine had thought of really anything a guest might need - from hair conditioner in the bathroom to a selection of teas and some small snacks in the kitchen. And we really loved the beautiful porch, where we could have spent the entire holiday and where we had a nice chat and a glass of wine with our hosts one evening. The location on Staten Island is very convenient, itâ\\x80\\x99s a ten minutes walk to the ferry (you can also take the bus). The ride on the boat offers you the most wonderful views of Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty every day - for free! \\nSo itâ\\x80\\x99s an absolute thumbs up for this lovely place, which feels like a haven of peace in exciting and pulsating New York City!'),\n",

The 2 small negative points are the 4 floors (but well.... it's done), and the noise of the air conditioning blocks outside (think of the earplugs). The advantage is that there is no street noise. Otherwise nothing to report, everything is as described. Carole is reactive to the messages and questions we ask ourselves, and gives just before arrival all the information to access the apartment. I recommend. Carol's place was an excellent location to visit Manhattan and accommodated all 6 of us without a problem.  Carol was very helpful and responsive.  I would gladly stay there again on my next visit to NY! We had a nice stay!  This was our first Airbnb experience and it was a great one. Starting with the great communication with Carol, it could not have been smoother. We loved everything about our experience! Thank you Carol, for a truly wonderful getaway in NYC!!!  Excelente ubicacion, zona muy tranquila y muy cercas del Times Square Beautiful place to stay!

Carol was really easy to reach, we never met in person but she always responded to any and all of my questions/concerns. Her place was really well kept and I liked the decorations that she put in her place. \\nFew cons:\\n-The toilet seemed a little loose, like it wasn't tightened properly in place. But Carol did warn us that the toilet would flush weakly. \\n-The bedroom was a little dark for me, I felt that I had to strain to see anything in there.\\n- I may have overlooked this when I booked the place, but this place is on the third floor and there is no elevator, so being there for a week definitely kept me in shape. \\nOverall, Carol was super accepting that we had 6 people stay at her place, she even had enough blankets and sheets for all of us! I would definitely recommend Carols place. It's a good place to stay. Carolâ\\x80\\x99s apartment was clean, she was a great communicator, and was flexible with our check in and check out. The apartment is exactly as advertised and fit three friends perfectly. Had a great visit! Carol is a really good host. She answered all of my questions and give tips about the neighborhood. The apartment is really nice! I stayed there with my parents and brother and it was perfectly comfortable. The building don't have a elevator but definitely it isn't a problem. The only thing that I think could be change is about the light in the bedroom, looks a bit dark, but isn't a problem too. The location is really good, some steps and you are in a amazing points of the city. Subway is from some steps too. Perfectly. I certainly recommend this place :)\"),\n",

You will not be disappointed. We had a great stay! Alfredo's roommate is really nice and helpful! The dog is adorable! Before we started our trip to NY we booked a room with a shared bathroom in the apartement of Alfredo and John who were the perfect hosts! Quick to respond in a very friendly and nice way. When we arrived at the apartement we received a warm welcome from John and the cute dog Gizmo. It was really fun and the talk to John was very entertaining with a lot of good tips for public transport and so on. Furthermore, John told us that he will leave spontaneously to LA for the time of our stay. So we got an upgrade from a private room with shared bathroom to an entire apartement. A great benefit! Alfredos and Johns apartement is located in the west of Midtown Manhatten and was close to everything. Restaurants, supermarkets and shops are all nearby. Central Park, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Fifth Avenue, Macys and all lines of public transport are away only a few minutes of walking distance. The apartement is the perfect location to explore the city. If i come back to NY i would definitely stay again at Alfredos and Johns apartement. And i can highly recommend everyone to do the same.

Clean space, close to a 24/7 deli and a pharmacy is nearby, walkable distance from train (~15 Min walk or you can take the bus), ceiling is low but my 6â\\x80\\x992â\\x80\\x9d friend could stand up straight (if he had been any taller though he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have), easy to get into manhattan (takes 40 Min to an hour but itâ\\x80\\x99s a simple commute), basic cookware and seasonings are provided along with many bathroom supplies. The space above is also let out and you can hear people walking above you sometimes but it isnâ\\x80\\x99t terrible  Great place!  Great for 2 people in Brooklyn for the price! Super clean and fast response. This was our first time with Airbnb and it was great. I think the description of Stace's place is very clear, so you know from a start what you are booking. The neigborhood is absolutely nice and safe and the people we met were nice and welcoming. The apartment was very clean with a lot of small details which make you feel like at home-you have everything you need and that's the way we felt there-like at home. We didn't meet Stace in person, but she was very nice everytime I asked her something. We would definitely stay again at Stace's place :)  not exactly what I was expecting based on the listing but it was cool Nice litte apartment. Totally worth it! This appaetement looks exactly as on the pictures. It was clean and cosy. It is located at basement, so there are no windows, but it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t any problem and we had good sleep. Stace is a great host, who does her best for our happiness. She was very communicative and helpful. Stace is a great host! She responded quickly to any questions I  had. Her place was clean, quiet and comfortable. It was a good location close to anything youâ\\x80\\x99d need. Thank you Stace! Cool place! Stace was awesome! Thank you! This place was exactly what I was expected. It was quiet and cozy. Plenty of space for parking if you travel by car, just a quick tip - be aware of parking, from 8:30 - 10 am is a street cleaning, just notice what side of the road is available that day.\"),\n",

Near Atlantic/Barclays for getting around town, close to so many great dining and still a quiet place to escape the city! Canâ\\x80\\x99t wait to have more family/friends in town so we can rent this place again! The space was very clean.  The bed and sofa bed were very comfortable.  We enjoyed the cold water bottles in the fridge and the Keurig coffee.  The apartment was steps away from the Barclay center and there were great restaurants nearby. Great location, clean apartment, excellent hosts.  Plenty of eateries and drinking establishments around.  Perfect if attending an event at Barclays.  Wonderful little Brooklyn apartment! Perfect location! Easy access to the subway and shops around the Barclay's Center. We will definitely stay here again. Clean and tidy. Awesome place, Carol was a great host.  Had a wonderful stay in Flatbush. I was just a 5 minute walk from the Barclayâ\\x80\\x99s Center , parking wasnâ\\x80\\x99t hard to find and it was a lovely space . Iâ\\x80\\x99d definitely  come back again.  Excellent location accessible to NYC and all 5 boroughs. Barclays Center is right across the street for any main venue. Amazing walk ability. Only issues was the TV reception which was not a big deal. Also not enough bath towels. But we did not mention this to our host as I am sure they would have accomadated our needs. Would definitely book again in the future. I would return but not during a heat wave.  AC appeared to be vented into the hall.

Kent was out of town for the first few days of my stay, but was always quick to respond to my messages. The bed was one of the most comfortable bed's I've stayed in an AirBnB, there was a desk in the room that wasn't in the pictures (so that's a bonus to me), and all of the shared spaces (bathroom, kitchen) were kept super clean.\\n\\nThe location itself is great - Just a little off the beaten path from all of the action in East Village, so its pretty quiet, but really easy to go out if that's what you want.\\n\\nAside from that, Kent is an amazing host and person. I just moved to NY and was staying at his place while waiting to move into my own place, and Kent offered ton's of great recommendations on spots to check out in the neighborhood, as well as advice for living in NY. \\n Very comfy bed! Highly recommend staying here. Great hosts, the best location, lovely quiet room, clean apartment. The only suggestion I would make to other guests is to bring a sleep mask if you are sensitive to light because the blinds do not block out light and in the morning it is very bright. The location was as expected, perfect. My husband and I are in our 30s and bars and restaurants were walking distance. Check in was seamless and Kent was helpful with recommendations for food spots- he was very welcoming and easy to talk to. The room is actually bigger than expected seeing as most NY apartments can be quite cramped. The bathroom is enough to shower and brush your teeth but thatâ\\x80\\x99s also common for NY. The bed was also very comfortable. The only drawback was it was summer and hot when we went and there isnâ\\x80\\x99t central air, so youâ\\x80\\x99re walking into a warm apartment until you turn your personal a/c on in your room (which needs to be switched off when youâ\\x80\\x99re out for the day) it gets to feel rather damp because of this. It all depends of personal preference, Iâ\\x80\\x99m very hot natured. Kent and Nikki were great hosts. Although they were out of town, they were great communicators and very flexible with check in / check out. Would certainly recommend Un appartement trÃ¨s bien situÃ© pour visiter la ville et dans un quartier qui bouge beaucoup.

They responded to emails immediately and/or came to us right away to answer our questions or concerns.\\nThere was plenty of street parking but using their driveway was an added pleasure.\\nIt is conveniently located. There is a bus right on the corner that gets to the subway in about 15 minutes. The subway gets into the city in about 20 minutes. You can walk to the subway in about 20 minutes if you choose this option. It is also very easy to get on to major highways to travel into city or go to Long Island.\\nThe residence is accurately portrayed in the pictures. The bathroom was recently updated and is very attractive. The kitchen has refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker and all of the expected kitchen utensils.\\nThe bedroom has many dressers to store clothing. There are closets, but they need to be updated ( one was missing a handle). The bed was most comfortable. The internet worked very well. The tv worked fine, but only has subscription channels ( Netflix, amazon prime, etc.)- no regular channels.\\nOverall, our stay worked out well. A clean space and a comfortable space.\\n\\nYou only share washer and dryer.\\n\\nLovely hosts and all amenities are available.\\n\\nYou are in a lovely basement space so expect footsteps infrequently.\\n Die Unterkunft war wie beschrieben und liegt in einem angenehmen Viertel in New York. Man fÃ¼hlt sich sicher und es gibt viele EinkaufsmÃ¶glichkeiten in der nahen Umgebung. Die Subway lÃ¤sst sich gut zu FuÃ\\x9f, aber auch mit dem Bus erreichen. Kontakt zu den Gastgebern hatten wir nicht viel, was aber daran lag, dass wir die wenigen Tage in NYC komplett ausgenutzt haben. Insgesamt sehr empfehlenswert! place was okay.  it\\'s a nice neighborhood,  the host was available by text. I didn\\'t like the footsteps in the morning and being watch when I stepped in and out. Besides that  it\\'s a great place for 2 people to stay. lovely home would recommend to all. larger then expected. only thing to note is ceiling height is not ideal for tall people (at 6\\'5\" I wasn\\'t always able to stand up straight lol) This is a cosy little 1-bedroom space (with a private kitchen and bathroom) in the basement of Jean\\'s house. It\\'s perfect for 2 or 3 travelers wishing to stay in Queens, and the neighborhood is pretty neat too. Clean linens, clean bathroom, trendy furniture, and a helpful and communicative host - there isn\\'t much to complain, really. The only downside is that the place is a 20-minute walk from the subway station, but there\\'s a bus that arrives right outside the house if you don\\'t like walking. On the whole, I\\'d fully recommend this place for a stay in Queens!'),\n",

As a host he greets you with a smile, is very friendly and makes you feel comfortable immediately. Would def stay again! Jeevan was a great host, his place was in a great location for me, and most important, my bed and room were clean and comfy - had a great sleep, which is all that matters to me. Great location! He responds real quick!  This was my second time staying at Jeevan's. It really is unbeatable for price and location! Jeevan is so helpful and friendly and makes himself available if there's anything you need and you instantly feel very at home in the space. The room itself has a very comfortable bed and bedding and an AC unit that worked wonders in the summer heat! Not to mention incredibly quiet space considering it is only a block from Times Square. Would definately return for a third time! Definitely a snug NYC apartment in an old building, but the location is very convenient! This space is conveniently located near Times Square and is a perfect place to stay for trips in and around the area. The place is clean and even has a personal AC to make the room comfortable to sleep. I would stay here again. My communication with Jevaan was really easy.

Every single detail about this place is 100% accurate. Her studio basement apartment was really nice and comfortable and felt like home. She also has the cutest family!!! She is helpful and goes out of her way to accommodate her guest. Great amenities and was the perfect location. I completely recommend staying here. Thanks again Anabell!!!!  Our stay at Anabellâ\\x80\\x99s was great from start to finish. We canceled early thinking it was too late to reserve the place. She was quick to answer us and inquire whether or not we still wanted to stay. She was very accommodating with the check in time due to it being very late, and stayed in constant contact. Everything was very convenient, and the space was stylish and clean. The area is very easy to navigate. Both the space and the host were great. Would definitely stay here again! I arrived much later than I had expected, but without question the best host I've ever had. Anabel made me felt right at home... I've used AirBnB all over the world to give a measurement of this review. Very easy to get around from that location as well and the neighborhood felt safe. Highly recommend.  I'm coming next week love this Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable. Annabell was very communicative and personable. We appreciated how close JFK was and the subway were to her space. Less than 10 minute  ride to the airport was perfect. We will stay again whenever weâ\\x80\\x99re in the area.\\nMegan and Tony First I want to say that Anabell was very nice and super responsive, but nice doesnâ\\x80\\x99t make up for the less than pleasant lexperience we had. It was a basement studio so I expected some noise, but with her family in town the amount of noise was unbearable. We also got woken up in the middle of the night by a crying puppy/dog, I finally got in touch with Anabell and she did take care of it. Overall the place was clean and for the most part as pictured. Anabell is so incredibly warm and kind. Our flight was cancelled and Anabell, knowing that we were stranded at JFK, had the place ready within an hour of me reaching out to her. It was so clean and she went out of her way to make sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed. The space is very comfortable and super close to JFK, which is exactly what we were looking for. Also,  her children are very polite and sweet. Would highly recommend staying with her if you need a place to stay that is close to JFK! Anabell is the definition of a super host. She went above and beyond to be hospitable and accommodate our every need to include keeping an eye on our car for us while we were away. The apartment is very quaint and well decorated. We were amazed at how well Anabell was able to fit so much into a small space yet still be comfortable. Every thing was thought of and sparkling clean. We have already booked our return stop with her and will definitely stay there in the future when we need to commute through JFK. Our stay was absolutely perfect... Anabell was by far the best Airbnb I have ever stayed with. If youâ\\x80\\x99re looking for quick communication, superb hospitality, and a clean & quiet atmosphere, then Anabellâ\\x80\\x99s is the place to go... I almost didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to write a review because this means she might be too booked for me to stay there next time, lol!! I highly recommend to everyone.. You wonâ\\x80\\x99t be disappointed!  Anabell was such a great host! Her and her family made our first air bnb experience a great one. She was so quick to respond and help us out with any questions we had. Location was awesome and minutes away from everything and the studio was so cute and clean! Great for me and my husband. Thank you for a lovely stay and for making our stay in New York a great one!  Anabell is easily the best host on AirBnB. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s one of the sweetest humans Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever met! She really went above and beyond to make sure our stay was nothing but awesome. Her place is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood very close to jfk. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll definitely be back! :) Anabell was the absolute perfect host. Kept communication at all times, answered every question I had. She gave me a tour of the place, showed me where everything was, and gave me tips on the best food spots in town! The place was sparkling clean, smelled amazing, and the bed was incredibly comfortable, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to leave. I loved the decoration and amenities. The outside of the house was also stunning. I highly recommend Anabellâ\\x80\\x99s cozy studio apartment if youâ\\x80\\x99re around the JFK area! Will definitely be staying here again in the future :)  Anabell was such an incredible host. She was so warm and friendly, and truly made us feel at home. She worked around our schedule, and gave us a thorough tour upon arrival. The studio itself was so comfortable. It offered all the ammenities listed, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Would definitely stay here again!  Anabellâ\\x80\\x99s place is very clean and well organized; we really liked staying there. We booked for a JFK layover here  as it is close to the airport (average $15 uber ride each way). Coffee, bottled water and snacks were provided.  Netflix/Prime Video is available on the TV. We would stay there again the next time we need a place in NYC. amazing as always! clean, cool, accommodating, and anabell responds quickly all the time. Anabell is a fantastic host. She is kind, attentive, and helps you will anything you need! The place is clean and organized with nice touches all around to help your stay more than comfortable. I recommend to anyone who is looking for a place that makes you feel at home. Thank you again Anabell!  Anabell is the most thoughtful host I've ever had the pleasure of staying with through Airbnb. The private apartment in the basement of her lovely home was the perfect place to stay overnight before an early flight at JFK. The location is unbeatable, as the airport is a five-ten minute drive away. I cannot recommend Anabell's home and warm hospitality enough! Anabellâ\\x80\\x99s place was a great place to come to rest after leaving JFK airport. It was spotless, had several nice amenities that you donâ\\x80\\x99t away get (washer and dryer) and she was extremely communicative and made the stay great. I would definitely recommend it if you are going to or leaving JFK! wow was amazing felt like i was home away from home was nice and relaxing  Great place to stay for Business or vacations.  Anabell is a great host. She keeps a spotless place and it was a perfect location for me. She is very nice and hospitable, and really cares about you, your trip and your stay. Annabell, her husband and her little daughter gave us a perfect first experience of Airbnb. She was very nice. Her husband even brought us to the JFK airport on the next day for free. The room was clean and we had everything we needed there. The area seems to be a calm area near the airport. We hope there will be chance to see Annabell and her family again! Annabell's place is way way better than I expected. It was the cleanest place we (me and my husband) stayed over several Airbnb bookings. The whole place is spotless, towels and sheets smell like freshly laundied. We just felt so comfortable there. Annabell is very welcoming and thoughtful, which made our experience easy and relaxing. She will reply my message almost immediately, I have never get this kind of 5 stars costume service anywhere. If I visit NYC again, I will definitely book with her! I had an amazing experience staying with Anabell!!! I would HIGHLY recommend her place =)\\n\\nI was connecting through JFK en route from London, but got stuck/couldn't fly out of JFK as a result of thunder storms in NYC. To make matters worse, my flight didn't get cancelled until very late. Luckily, Anabell's place was available!\\n\\nShe was INCREDIBLE to get the place ready at 11pm, waited for me to arrive so she could PERSONALLY check me in, and gave me everything you would want after a very long travel day: fresh towels, a comfortable bed, lots of water, and a very cosy place.\\n\\nAnabell's place is so conveniently located and in close proximity to JFK, that catching an early flight the next day was a breeze!\\n\\nThank you, Anabell!!! Will definitely stay again when I'm in the area =)\\n\\n What a convenient and pleasant stay. I had a last minute trip to NYC for one day and then an early flight from JFK the next morning. This place was convenient, comfortable, and easy as can be.  The host was WONDERFUL - very responsive, flexible, and tons of thoughtful information guides (how to turn on the TV, etc) to make the stay easy.  Thank you. I will be back!! Anabell's place is the perfect jumping off spot if you are traveling out of JFK. It is on a quiet dead end street a short uber or cab ride from the airport. The room is super cute and clean and Anabell is over the top accommodating in every way. If you fly in and out of JFK and need a place to leave your car this is an exalent solution. I would highly recoment this place to enyone. Anabell was an Amazing host! My husband and I returned from a long trip to Egypt and decided to stay in NY a few days after for some additional R&R. Anabell made it a point to meet us in person and give us a walk through of her property. Very clean, great amenities, comfy furniture, and a large screen TV with free movies! We felt right at home which was great after a long trip. She made sure to offer eating locations, stores close by and even provided take out menus in case we wanted to stay in! We really felt at home and wished we could have stayed longer. We will definitely use her accommodations on our next visit to NY. Choose Anabell for your visit...you will not be disappointed! Much love Anabell...till next time!\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Darrick and Leslie Goodman  Super close from the airport. Nice TV and bed. everything was perfect. Anabell was an extra polite and helpful host (very quick and detailed response!). I only rate our stay at 4 stars due to some slight noise issues we had in the morning (Anabell mentioned her neighbor's dog was barking and that she'd bring that to their attention for the future) and due to the fact that eat-in amenities were scarce (no kitchen sink, and no paper plates or plastic utensils for example). I brought that to Anabell's attention, and she said she'd be leaving more items available for guests in the future. Lastly, despite the proximity to the airport (10 min drive) I think the price is just a tad high for what you get. That being said, you won't find an easier host to communicate with! We arrived in the middle of the night from JFK. Anabellâ\\x80\\x99s place was a perfect pitstop before the morning. Itâ\\x80\\x99s super close to the airport, has everything youâ\\x80\\x99d need for a quick stay, and sheâ\\x80\\x99s amazing at communication. Iâ\\x80\\x99d definitely stay there again, thanks Anabell! Great cozy, comfortable apartment close to JFK. Anabell gives helpful tips and was very responsive throughout. Washer/dryer extremely convenient between legs of travel. There is a microwave, but note that there is no kitchen and the only sink is in the bathroom.  Very nice person provided many extras and alway available for any assistance  Anabell was a great host. Super responsive and went out of her way to be helpful. The apartment was perfect for a place to crash before our early flight. Very tidy and lovely place equipped with everything you need. A good bed and nice bathroom. Anabell is a great host and was always there when you need her. Very nice and wants to share all she know about the area. We had a great stay and I recommend it to anyone looking for a place in the area. Anabell is a great hostess with a sparkling personality.  She makes you feel right at home! Clean, friendly host, great place to stay.  Book with confidence! This was my first Airbnb experience and if every booking is like this, then I will never turn to a hotel again. Anabell was a lovely host, warm and welcoming. Communication was clear and response was fast. The studio apartment had everything I needed. It was spacious, clean and inviting. It offered both security (keypad lock) and privacy (it's own entrance). She was very accommodating with such last minute booking. I felt comfortable and appreciated the tour of the apartment on arrival. This Airbnb is 5/5. Definitely one I'll rebook. Highly recommended to my fellow Airbnbers. THANK YOU ANABELL! :D Anabell was a great host with such a welcoming way about herself, she made our arrival back home to the US from a two week trip in Europe so warm and comfortable! The best way to come back home and be greeted with the hospitality she provided. I would recommend staying with Anabell, we had everything we needed and more. From the Netflix & hot chocolate before bed, to coffee and shower in the morning we were set and felt back at home.

It is a separate apartment and she was kind enough to greet us and give us a little tour upon arrival. The space was much larger than I had expected (it had a separate sitting area with a couch and TV) and having the use of a washer and dryer after a 2 week trip was a life saver! If you need any suggestions of places to eat or things to do - she is happy to help! I highly recommend her and her place if you need a place to stay in the area! Anabell is an outstanding host. Right from start, she made my Aunt and I  feel welcomed. She greeted us, shiwed us around and said to let her know if we needed anything.  I would definitely recommend Anabell to family and friends. I hope to go back and visit again soon. Fantastic Host. Anabellâ\\x80\\x99s place was the perfect spot to land after arriving late in the evening from JFK. Less than a ten minute drive from the airport, itâ\\x80\\x99s exactly what we needed for our brief one night stay.

       "  \"We had a wonderful stay and will surely look for this same place on our next trip to NYC.\\n\\nThis was the perfect chance to live in a typical New York apartment from 1886. After our month-long stay we ended up feeling like home here.\\n\\nThe apartment is on a 3rd floor (2 flights, no elevator) but that was no problem at all for us. It is in the back of the building so you won't hear a thing at night. The bed was very comfortable, too!\\n\\nThe place has everything you need and more in every corner. Big-sized TV with and Apple TV that comes with Netflix, Hulu and HBO Go services (no live TV, but we didn't need it anyway). Wi-Fi service was fast and stable. There's even a Bluetooth Bose speaker so you can listen to music with high quality sound.\\n\\nWe love the Washington Square area so it is perfectly located. Everything we like is a few blocks away.\\n\\nIn conclusion, everything was great!\\n\\n Had a great stay here, the location is fantastic. Many great food and drink options right on the doorstep and a convenient 5 minute walk to the subway. We also really appreciated the list of close-by places for coffee and food provided, we tried out some of the recommendations and they were fab. Thanks for a memorable trip to this great city! Apartment is in the most amazing location, beautifully decorated and exceptionally clean. Pickup and drop off of key was close by and easy. Remarkably, given the location in the heart of the Village, the apartment was wonderfully quiet at night. My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay again. Amazingly cute little studio (slightly smaller than pictured). Slightly difficult stair case for those with heavy luggage. was an amazing location right next to Washington square park. Great location and easy access for a quick trip to the city. Everything you might need is very close by and the info left in the apartment was helpful as well. Small space but great for a single or couple stay. Great place  Fun Greenwich Village apartment!  A great area to stay in - close to subway and close to many restaurants.  Communication was excellent.  Key pick up and drop off was easy, and all the instructions were very clear.  Great restaurant recommendations provided for the area.  The apartment was small, but very comfortable and clean and we felt like we got a real glimpse of NY living.  Also not loud at night, despite being a popular neighbourhood with lots going on.  We had a great stay!  Our stay was perfect for what we needed during a busy week in NYC. Would stay again! Very Nice place in Greenwich Village near Washington Square. Very nice appartement, all good for services and accommodations !!!\\nThanks Kyle, Recommend it ! I travel to New York at least once a year and Jeff's place is in one of the best locations in all of Manhattan.  Check in and check out was super smooth and easy and Jeff provided a lot of local tips on places to go, eat, etc. The apartment is old, but you should know that staying in such a prime location in Greenwich Village.  Super clean and bed was very comfortable.  I would definitely stay in Jeff's place again! Jeffery's place was exactly as advertised. The location is excellent, the bed is comfortable and it was very quiet in the apartment. We really enjoyed our stay. Very nice typical new York appartement \\nGreat location.\\nThe hosts were very reactive. Great location!

Besides the standard accommodations, she provided snacks and light breakfast (the biscuit that she made was amazing!!). We arrived on a rainy day, she also had umbrellas ready for us.

Michelle\\'s apartment is in a great location close to SO many of the best restaurants. Her guest bedroom was also stocked with tips and recommendations. Great wifi. Michelle was really sweet and conversational, and I\\'d recommend her place to anyone else and may want to stay again myself! Michelle\\'s place was perfect for my stay in NYC. Very walkable neighborhood, only a couple blocks to the subway, very comfortable private bedroom (with A/C!) and clean apartment. Welcoming host, would certainly stay again. we loved her place in Chinatown! clear and friendly communication, very  clean apartment and enough  cozy space. close to subway and not so far from Brooklyn Bridge. Michelleâ\\x80\\x99s place was absolutely perfect! So close to subway and has very nice restaurants in the area. Great WiFi and even has bagels and oatmeal for breakfast. Thanks again Michelle, would love to come back. Great location and a friendly, helpful welcoming host! This is a fantastic place to stay in NYC! Perfect location for exploring the city  Great! Easy check in, cozy room, sound machine, clean home, close to things, perfect for a long weekend in the city ! We spend a very great experience at NYC in Michelle \\'s charming flat such as \"real\" new yorker :) It is really near from subway and you can even walk until the financial district or docks. The breakfast is good (tea, coffee, bagels, yogourth) before to begin long days of walk. Everything was well indicated, it was easy to know what we can do or not.\\nMichell is really nice and available even if we didn\\'t see her a lot.   Michelles place was just what I needed for my short stay in Manhattan. Convenient to the Subway. 3 blocks to a great place to run in the mornings. Clean, with coffee , Bagels, Jam and butter for the morning. The space was small but well thought out. I never felt cramped. Lots of thoughtful touches that helped make the stay better. Michelle and Richard answered my questions and offered to help me understand the Subway system since it was my first time in New York. But, I did not need that since it was very easy to navigate. If you are a single traveler Michelles place is a great spot to base for your Manhattan stay. Es war absolut sauber und gut zu finden! Coole Gegend mit verschiedenen Lokalen! Das Zimmer ist klein aber super sÃ¼Ã\\x9f eingerichtet, man hat alles  was man braucht und in New York verbringt man ja eh kaum Zeit auf dem Zimmer :) Very clean. Nice apartment. Bed is like a cot and extremely uncomfortable.  We loved our stay. The place was clean and the bed comfortable. Location was good. Michelle was accommodating and very discreet. \\n\\nThank you Michelle. See you very soon we hope. \\n\\nB&A Michelle\\'s place was perfect for us. Very charming and well located to discover Manhattan and Brooklyn. The appartment is really cosy and peaceful to have a rest after a long day of sightseeing and walking through the city. It feels like being in a cocoon in the mid of crazy busy NYC.  Her tips about restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood were great! I absolutely loved how cozy, clean, and central Michelleâ\\x80\\x99s airb&b was. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting New York City! Michelleâ\\x80\\x99s place was very tidy and in a great location! Easily accessible to the local transportation and you can be anywhere within a reasonable time. This place is definitely where to be for the Lower Eastside experience! The apartment is perfectly located in the Lower East Side, close to two metro stations (East Broadway and Hessex St less than 10min). The room is cosy, well decorated and clean (as the rest of the apartment btw). I\\'d definitely recommend Michelle and her apartment.'),\n",

For the first time we used the site for renting an apartment and were satisfied. Very hospitable hostess, was with us on the connection always. I met and helped with accommodation. There were products for the first time in the apartment. The taxi is very comfortable. Three minutes by metro and a bus stop. park.na the first floor of the house there is a shop, a good cafe across the road. Thanks! mv glad that stopped at Lees The pics donâ\\x80\\x99t lie. The space is quaint, cozy and decorated with amazing art. The brownstone is on the 2nd floor and the stairs are steep so be prepared for a climb. But when you reach the entrance... youâ\\x80\\x99re hit with gorgeousnesses! \\n\\nIt was hot and stormy in Harlem, but  the place is well equipped with ways to keep cool. AC unit in the front room and bedroom areas (bedroom has ceiling fan too) and a powerful little fan that can be moved to the bathroom if needed.  There were even waters, juices and apple sauces left for usâ\\x80\\x94 oh yeah and croissants. \\n\\nNice huge comfy bed, WiFi and nice TVâ\\x80\\x99s in the front and bed rooms. There are so many places within walking distance; grocery stores, liquor stores, restaurants and other places a short LYFT or UBER ride away. \\n\\nAny questions or concerns I had Lisa responded immediately and the check-in was easier than expected. She even allowed us to stay past normal check-out because of our late flights. Truly one of the best Air BnB experiences Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever had. I see why sheâ\\x80\\x99s a super host.  Great apartment in a great location, with a great host. If you get a chance to stay here, take it and enjoy your visit to the big apple even more than you would expect. What can I say about Leesa's place?  \\n\\nFirstly, Leesa is a first class communicator.  From the very first message I sent through 6 months before our trip, right up until I got back home afterwards.  This was my first time booking AirBnB and Leesa made sure I was happy with answers to every single question which I am sure she has heard before.\\n\\nShe was flexible with checkin and checkout and gave me so much information about making my stay as comfortable and enjoyable as she could.\\n\\nLeesa was not there at checkin although I did get a chance to meet her a couple of times during our stay.  There was a parade on the day I arrived and some streets were closed.  I was made aware of every single detail of this and how best to work around it on the day.  It just seemed that Leesa aware of everything and helped with all preparations.\\n\\nThe location was absolutely perfect.  All I wanted to easy travel to Yankee Stadium (I was attending 3 games in that week) and also easy to travel to down town.  Subway is super close and we used Uber and Cabs as well.  All were easy but the Subway is crazy cheap.  \\n\\nWe felt welcome everywhere we went in Harlem.  We felt more welcome in Harlem than anywhere else in New York.  We walked back from bars after midnight without any issue, granted this was during the week.  It does get a bit busier and louder on the weekends.  \\n\\nThe stairs are steep as other reviews suggest but my 130kg mate got up and down them without any problem, large suitcases would be a slight challenge.  It can get noisy in the loungeroom as the police precinct is half a block away so you will hear some sirens/traffic/people.  Not an issue from the bedroom and the loungeroom windows can be closed which made a big difference.\\n\\nLeesa is just wonderful.  She went so far out of her way to help, I would rent any property she was ever involved with.  I cannot recommend this place enough.  If you stay, you must checkout Harlem Nights especially on open mic night (Monday night).\\n\\nMatt\"),\n",

Arabella was very fast to respond to any questions and proactive in communication. it's a nice space, ideal for a couple who likes to explore Manhattan. the views are amazing and you find plenty restaurants, shops and public transport nearby. the flat sure has character - including some blinds instead of a bedroom door for one of the bedrooms and does contain - compared to my other airbnb experiences - an unusually high amount of personal stuff, which doesn't leave loads of stoe space (but enough if you move things around a bit). the owner responds  quickly and reliably and be prepared for lots of instructions and maybe some surprises during communication ahead of check-in. having said that, if your a bit flexible and don't mind following strict rulez, you'll have a glorious time. we sure did! Great place, nice view on the city skyline and especially empire State building during the night! Close to must see things in New York. You have everything you need in the appartment.

Great host, great location, very clean. They need to be specific as to where its exactly located, because its literally between business\\'. There is a high level of stairs you need to walk up to get to the apartment so pack lightly. Also with the late check in, i expected a much more better job in the cleanliness in the backyard. There were multiple old cigarette wrappers in the back deck. The back door had a hard time opening and closing but UPON arrival the host let us know the door was a little \"hard\" to open and close. The layout of the apartment is accurate it is a little small but with the updated appliances and hardwood floors it made it feel more roomy. During the end of our stay the roof in the living room started to leak which was kind of annoying because i kept having to change the pots so it wouldn\\'t leak all over the living room. Other than that i would give it a 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it to anyone that is just doing a quick last minute visit.'),\n",

Itâ\\x80\\x99s super close to an A train stop that you can also access via the ferry. Itâ\\x80\\x99s far enough away from the ferry stop though that there arenâ\\x80\\x99t crazy crowds which is exactly what we were looking for. But it was a short bike ride down the boardwalk to restaurants like our favorite, Caracas! The apartment is super cute and clean and we could walk to the stop n shop down the street and cook meals at the apartment. Our only complaint is that the beds are pretty hard but I would definitely recommend this place and would love to stay there again! Anna's place is a great spot! My partner and I + 2 other couples stayed for 5 nights. It's a spacious place and perfect for a staycation with a full kitchen + fast wifi! We enjoyed it  a lot. Like others have said - some of the beds are a bit firm. So, although it's billed as a relaxing place - there's definitely room for mattress upgrades + couch upgrade [it's like laying on an airplane seat to watch a movie ...] For the cost, I would have expected some more comfortable amenities + actual sheets on the bed - it was just a light comforter. However, that is probably our only minor complaint! We loved staying here - it was close to the train, the beach and the grocery store. Plus, the washer + dryer are a huge bonus! We would definitely love to be back. Note - there are about 20 steps to get from front door to the apartment - thankfully we are all able-bodied but this would be really difficult if you have trouble doing stairs. Just a heads-up! If you're staying at the beach with a group for a week or so - this is a fantastic spot!   Our family had a wonderful experience staying at this property, while visiting the Rockaways. The house is a 7 minute walk from a beautiful section of the beach and an easy drive to the super market and local eateries.

We had the best time ever and would definitely come back. Highly recommend this place 7 of us enjoyed staying at Anna's Airbnb for a weekend in August and really enjoyed the layout, space and accommodations that were provided. The apartment is part of larger complex so the living area, dining area, kitchen, two bedrooms and bathroom were on the 3rd floor and another bedroom, patio and smaller bathroom were on the 4th floor. \\n\\nThe place was clean when we got there and the self check-in process was easy. Many of the reviews note that the beds were firm but we thought they were just fine! The kitchen met all of our basic needs and we would definitely love to stay here again if we find ourselves out in the Rockaways again. Casa molto bella e accogliente per passare ina giornata sull'oceano. La consiglio anche per chi deve poi partire da jfk. If you want to enjoy the best part of Far Rockaway beach, stay at Annaâ\\x80\\x99s place. Very clean place. Would recommend bringing additional blankets for the bed and oh by the way the bedrooms all face the L train tracks which runs all night.\"),\n",

The check-in process is easy, and the place is clean.\\nThere are two metro stations nearby to help you going around. If you need something, there is a convenience store nearby as well. It was not pleasant experience. The neighborhood does not feel safe at night (we faced police raiding next door house one night). The cleanliness of the toilet was very very bad. Toilet paper was out a couple of times and it feels like a hostel which is not being taken care of.  As long as you know what youâ\\x80\\x99re singling up for, this isnâ\\x80\\x99t a bad stay. Just be advised that itâ\\x80\\x99s basically a small hostel. The bed was comfortable, room was clean, and A/C did itâ\\x80\\x99s job, so no major sleep issues. The other guests seemed friendly. Not a bad location as Ridgewood seems to be adding cool establishments by the minute. Very close to the L and M subways, which was perfect for my plans. I felt very safe. The place is located in Brooklyn and it's a about 15-minute commute to Manhattan, so this is a great place to stay when one wants to explore the city. The apartment was clean. The kitchen area didn't meet our expectations, as it did not have any kitchen supplies in it (no cutlery, plates, mugs, and so on). Other than that, the place was clean and as described.\\nWe got the wrong address upon check-in which caused some problems as we ended up in the wrong place. After solving that issue, the self check-in was convenient. Nothing fancy but very clean and convenient. Perfect for a quick stay. Just to be clear - this is a room in a house that is fully rented out room by room. Room was tiny with very little space for 2 people, but it was OK. Quite close to the subway, with a few good coffee shops and bars around. Not the cleanest nor nicest area, but we've found a few nice bars and generally the area felt safe.  Kitchen was ridiculous however - there is absolutely no way to cook anything in the apartment, no dishes or cutlery. There is only a toaster and a microwave, which means that you can't really cook anything. I would avoid staying here if you intend to stay for longer than several days.\"),\n",

Thanks again for the hospitality. We had a great time in New York at Ruth's place. Check in was very easy and quick, she was there available to show us the house. There was plenty of space for my husband and I plus 4 teens. We felt safe in the eighborhood, even coming back at night. No problem parking there or by the metro stop (it was a weekend). The metro stop is just a few blocks away,  not too far to walk, but there are buses too, or if you have a car you can park by the metro. Getting to Manhattan was easy, direct line, and not too long. Keeping in mind that New York is one of the most expensive cities in the world, this place offers a very good value. Ruth's home is a great value. It is a 15 minute walk to the subway and a 45 minute ride to Manhattan.  The neighborhood is nice (still a city so be smart) with grocery, restaurants and carry out close by. The house is clean and fairly comfortable. For the price, you can't do better in NYC.  The apartment comfortably fit the six of us. There was plenty of storage and room to move. The apartment is a 12-15 min walk away from 3 subway stations with lines that run frequently into Manhattan. The neighbourhood is safe -night and day. There are shops,parks and laundromats close by. We found it to be a great base for our holiday to NY. This 3 bedroom apartment is clean,comfortable and was large enough for the 6 if us. We were a 12 minute walk from 3 different subway stations and there were plenty of shops nearby. The area is safe and clean and was a great base for us for going to Manhattan. Brooklyn is interesting to explore too. Ruth was a great host . Ruth was amazing, easy going and understanding. Her apartment was absolutely responding to the offer, very cozy. We can definitely recommend :) Excelente experiÃªncia !! We were delighted with our stay at Ruth's apartment. As we on tight budget we were looking for something that had 3 bedrooms (not 2 with a sofa bed as many others offer) that was in good condition, accessible to the city and with a reasonable price. Ruth's place ticked all our boxes. The home was comfortable and had everything we needed and Ruth always kept in touch to reassure us that we were not going to be left in the lurch. When we arrived Ruth met us and was very friendly and ready to help with any additional needs that arrived. All in all we are so grateful that Ruth provided us with the perfect accommodation for our needs. I wish you every success with your future Airbnb service. James Omg Ruth is so sweet. She showed us around the apartment when we arrived and was very accommodating. Will definitely stay again next time weâ\\x80\\x99re in Brooklyn.

Check in great without fuss. If you want a spacious urban cool place this is it.  Great place, large and very convenient,  well kept and comfortable. This is a beautiful, giant apartment that has been converted into a place intended for Airbnb (although the building clearly does not approve of such activities).  We were in town for a week for a conference and in many ways the apartment met or exceeded expectations - 10 min walk to Times Square, beautiful renovated bathrooms and kitchen, 4 private bedrooms that could have slept more than the 6 of us.  However, there were also several problems that affected our stay.  The air conditioner in the living space and the front bedroom does not cool (or dehumidify) those spaces adequately, so we spent a few very uncomfortable sweaty nights before someone was sent to adjust it.  Even then, with the thermostat set to 69, I never saw the temperature go below 77.   We could hear all the noise from the street and the gym below, but on the plus side, the apartment is huge so no noise from the other bedrooms reaches that room . . . We also had problems with the key to the external door, and when we reached out to the number we were given the responses were very rude.  In other dealings with Samuel, though, he was very helpful and polite.   This is a huge loft in an amazing location. Really cool rustic features. We were able to save a lot on hotels and food thanks to this!  muy lindo depto, bien ubicado... ruido de la autopista y el gimnasio abajo, mal balance del aire acondicionado (algunas habitaciones c frio y otras c calor) Apartamento enorme (mÃ¡s grande que en las fotos) y puesto con mucho estilo. Zona estupenda con todos los servicios. La comunicaciÃ³n con Samuel rÃ¡pida y fluida. Totalmente recomendable! The apartment is much larger than we expected, 4 good sized bedrooms and comfortably catered for 4 adults. In a great position and we were able to walk to most of the major sites including subway. The noise from buses accessing the terminal is an issue in the back bedrooms, there is an on ramp right outside the bedroom windows.  You will not be able to access the lift, apartnment is accessed via stairs (which we were fine with). everything else you will need is there (basic Roku subscription, wifi, basic kitchen amenities). Excellent communication from Samuel. Pros:  The apartment itself was amazing - huge space, great for multiple couples, clean with two great bathrooms, cool neighborhood.\\n\\nCons:  This building\\'s management definitely has issues with their apartments/condos being used for AirBnB - multiple notes posted in common areas specifically about AirBnB not being allowed in the building without permission from management.   In addition, Samuel\\'s house rules were quite extensive and seemingly unfair in a lot of ways:  Being told not to use the thermostat in the apartment when he has every hour individually programmed to 86 degrees led to several uncomfortably warm nights.  Bus noise is definitely an issue you will have to deal with in 2 of the bedrooms, and gym noise from the gym on the ground level was definitely noticable.  Having to request late checkout (10am?  Really?) and then being told \"It\\'s not possible\" 4 days prior to arriving in NYC for your wife\\'s birthday was a bummer.\\n\\nOverall:  Great apartment in Manhattan but it feels like you\\'re staying in a place where you\\'re not wanted or welcome. Fantastic location, big apartment, convenient. We use it as a base for our business trip, four of us were very comfortable and had our own privacy. The pictures/description match reality, plus much more! The space is beautiful. More than enough towels, body wash, shampoo, and conditioner provided in both showers. I would definitely recommend this!'),\n",

The neighbourhood is so quiet that it's easy to forget how close you are to everything you could want in NYC. The host met us in person and was very understanding that we were running late. He gave us a quick tour of the apartment and a detailed run down of all the amenities (how to work the TV,  recycling facilities etc). The apartment was fully equipped with absolutely everything a home needs. Host was wonderfully communicative, friendly and helpful. I would leave more stars if I could! We had a great experience. The apartment was clean and in a convenient location. The hosts were easy to communicate with as well. the owners are very very nice, very responsive and thoughtful.

Other than that it\\'s a fantastic little place for a person traveling alone or a couple. Allison was very accommodating and responsive. Great host and highly recommend staying in this place when you visit NYC. Great little spot! The neighborhood was lively but also quiet Great location! Right in the middle of alphabet city, with a lot of great places to eat and drink nearby. The apartment was nice, had all we needed. Perfect place to spend a night in New York, experiencing some city life Allison was always there if I needed her. Great place for a single or two travelers. Felt spacious despite being in NYC.  Allisonâ\\x80\\x99s Airbnb was a great location, great deal, and suited our needs perfectly. Allison quickly responded to messages and gave great suggestions on what the neighborhood had to offer. A few things to keep in mind if you are thinking of booking would be that is does not have WiFi and the bed isnâ\\x80\\x99t a true queen- itâ\\x80\\x99s 2 different twin mattresses. The bed was my biggest issue since it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t attached to a head board and the heights were off. The mattresses were comfortable however.  Highly recommend. Allison is punctual and offers her help! Made the trip an easy experience.  Allison\\'s location was amazing. I loved the neighborhood.  Allison\\'s place is a cute studio in the east village, about a 10 minute walk from the L train. The place is cozy, well decorated, and Allison take great care to individualize each guest\\'s experience. She went above and beyond to meet me and pick up my bags for an early arrival in NYC. Highly recommend! Allison was awesome, we were late getting to her place but she waited until we got there. She communicated really well. Her place is close to lots of eating places and bars in East village. Would recommend. Appartement trÃ¨s bien situÃ© , trÃ¨s bien reÃ§u malgrÃ© notre lâ\\x80\\x99arrivÃ©e tardive  Allison\\'s check-in policies were uncanny. She was super flexible and helpful with anything that we needed. You can tell she takes pride in being a great host. We loved the lower East Side and visited many bars and coffee shops within walking distance of the flat. We appreciated the Air Conditioner which kept up with the over 90 degree days the whole time we visited. We would love to stay here again. This was such a great place. It was a little far from some of the \"tourist\" spots but you can just hop on the metro to get to where ever you need to go. It is clean, well maintained, and bigger than you expect. Overall a really great place to stay for the price. \\n Il monolocale di Allison si trova in un\\'ottima posizione a East Village. Ã\\x88 piccolo, ma c\\'Ã¨ tutto. Gli spazi comuni come le scale sono sporchi, ma la stanza Ã¨ pulita anche se un po\\' vecchiotta. Molto tipica di uno studente americano. Allison Ã¨ stata super gentile e disponibile sia per l\\'accoglienza che per il check out. Purtroppo manca internet e questo Ã¨ un po\\' scomodo.\\n Great location! Allison is wonderful!! Super helpful, easy check in & out. Only wish is that the bed had been a real queen & not 2 separate beds pushed together Allison\\'s place is fantastic! I strongly recommend staying here. It has everything you could need and is in an amazing location. Allison is very kind and very quick to respond. Had a lovely stay here! Perfect and kind host. Nice flat in great neighborhood. I would definitively go there again! Allisonâ\\x80\\x99s place is in a prime location amongst a variety of bars & restaurants & walking distance to other great areas plus the subway. It was really clean & Allison was a fantastic communicator. She was also very flexible with our check-in time & could be contacted with any queries.  Allison was awesome since I booked the place months ago. She communicated with me quickly and offered many suggestions when I asked. The space was good for my boyfriend and I. We didnâ\\x80\\x99t have a car to go around and public transportation was a bit further than expected. We mainly used Uber and walked to get to and from the her Airbnb. No WiFi either which wasnâ\\x80\\x99t an issue since we had our hotspot. Overall very please with Allisonâ\\x80\\x99s place and would recommend it to anyone who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t need WiFi or doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mind walking/Uber.\\nThanks for having us! Wonderful space and perfectly located.  Allison is responsive and reliable host.  I felt so comfortable basing my travel plans around her accommodations. This is great and cozy place to be able to feel a life living in NYC! Great food and drinks are within walking distance. Allison is a great host! She responded to us quickly when we needed her and gave us great advice for food and coffee! Definitely recommend to stay! A great place to stay while visiting NYC. Allison was very responsive and an excellent host. Allisonâ\\x80\\x99s place is great! The apartment is situated in a really nice neighborhood with lots of amazing places to eat. Allison is a really good host, responds quickly to texts and she gave nice recommendations for foods. Everything we tried was amazing! I can recommend this place to everyone :) Good place for 1 night This is a great place for a great price in a neighborhood I love to stay in. Allison was great about communicating before our arrival and after. Allison was a really great host. She was flexible with our check in and out time. The studio is really cute and had everything we needed including fruit and coffee. I loved the neighborhood, it is very lively with plenty to do and eat. The subway stations are about 15 min or so away, and we enjoyed walking through the neighborhood to get there. As already mentioned in previous reviews, the bed was a bit awkward for a couple due to it being two twins pushed together with the mattresses being different heights and the beds not being secured together, so they roll away from each other. Even so, the studio is still an excellent value for NYC and I definitely recommend it. Great place, perfectly located. Was surprised that there wasnâ\\x80\\x99t Wi-fi but thereâ\\x80\\x99s so many places around, itâ\\x80\\x99s not a problem. Would recommend The apartment was nice and cozy and great location to restaurants, shops, and bars. Alli was nice and hospitable. Would stay again. Thanks! Allisonâ\\x80\\x99s apartment was great and so was she! We arrived earlier than expected and she personally greeted at the apartment.

Olga's apartment is in a great location on the upper East Side, about a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station. The room is sizable for Manhattan, and the bed is very comfortable. She also has air conditioning for the summer months. Olga is a great host, very friendly. She helped us with how to get in and out of the building and explained everything in good detail. The cat is friendly but the lock on the door kept him out of the bedroom without an issue.  Great amenities around the room and in the bathroom.

The apartment is cute and very spacious for the city. The building was always quiet (even street noise never got too loud! Some honking, but it's NYC) and while it's a three floor walk-up, the stairs were never a problem for us. The electronic lock worked well and Thomas was very responsive if we ever had issues or questions (such as needing to replace the batteries in the fire alarm). There's no central air but Thomas has kindly provided an AC unit for the main room, and each bedroom has a box air conditioner, all of which do an excellent job of keeping the apartment cool. The apartment was spotless when we arrived and while we mainly ate out or ordered food in, the kitchen is very well equipped for cooking. Overall, we had a spectacular stay and can't recommend this spot enough!  Awsome expiriance, very clean Location is great for NYU and everything in the Village. Easily catch the subway downstairs. The apartment is comfortable with a well stocked kitchen. Communication was prompt. We liked the coffee and pastry at Joe just down the block! Nice Place , Good location. This is a wonderful location and the apartment is completely comfortable and elegant. There are great restaurants in the area -- it's walking distance to so many places. We really had a great stay. A beautiful stay in my favorite spot on Manhattan. Close to the subway and many really good restaurants. Superb location.  Great space for NYC!  Super easy checkin.  I've stayed here a couple times and it is great! Great location in a beautiful NYC neighborhood. Spacious by New York standards, tons to do around the area. Thanks! The location for this apartment is AMAZING! This is an amazing Airbnb find in NYC- spacious high ceilings and amazing location! Thomas is also a very responsive host. You are right on a Main Street so it can be noisy, but I canâ\\x80\\x99t imagine any place wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be in NYC. Thank you so much Thomas and I highly recommend this Airbnb rental. Great location, comfortable layout.  The noise is nightly and is frequent, as it sits right on a main road. Thomas was quick to reply to our request for check in help and also check out.

Rati is also an Uber driver, and for a cheap price he came to pick us up to the airport in our arrival. This is a great plus, because at our arrival we were already sure to be able to find the flat and ask for concerns at the moment of check in. \\nThe flat was very clean, and, importantly, fully equipped!

The place was just right for the two of us and had everything we needed. Water pressure in the shower was great, the kitchen had everything we would want and having Netflix was a bonus. Very quiet but a great location in Hells Kitchen. We didn't take up Rati's offer of lifts to and from the airport but that may be a good option for some people.

Close to Manhattan with nice transit connections. Matt & Susan\\'s Williamsburg apartment was great. It was clean and easily accessible in a great location. Definitely recommend.  The apartment is very spacious, modern and clean; there is a construction side across the road, but it\\'s still pretty silent. Located in a new housing area, there is a ten minute walk to good restaurants and vintage shops. It took us about 30 minutes to get into the city and there is a good metro connection. The only thing that was bothering us, was the old and noisy AC, which BROKE half way through our stay. The host\\'s problem resolving despite fast communication and calming responses like \"We\\'ll take care of it!\"  was rather mediocre, as nothing was repaired and no instruction was given and ended with the host\\'s comment, saying: \"Lol\". In the end we had to manually trip the fuse, because the AC didn\\'t stop leaking and couldn\\'t be switched off. Apart from that and a missing toaster the stay was pleasant and recommendable for anyone who doesn\\'t want to stay in busy Manhattan and is looking for a designer flat with good amenities. Overall is okay but there is a problem with hot water. A nice apartment in a good location. Hosts friendly and easy to communicate with.  Great space!

Space is a lot smaller than what the photos represent, but the location was nice. Nice apartment, though smaller than expected based on the photos alone. The location is great and the rooftop has excellent views of the city. One downside was that the building seems to be populated by students or other Airbnbers, so there were some noisy parties during our stay and we saw bottles of alcohol left in the elevator. The apartment is quite sunny, which is nice, but the curtains don\\'t block out the sun at all, so I\\'d recommend bringing an eye mask for better sleep.  Matt & Susan\\'s place is spacious, clean, bright & very close to subway and great eating and drinking spots in Brooklyn. It is a great location to experience Williamsburg by foot and the rest of Brooklyn too, we walked down to Prospect Park one day and it was a lovely walk through the area. \\n\\nThe best part is that Matt & Susan were extremely quick to respond to all my questions and were always a pleasure to deal with.

The space was very clean, tidy and secluded, nothing to fault. Tracy is very welcoming and helpful, just a generally lovely person. Couldnâ\\x80\\x99t recommend anything better for a stay in New York. Tracy is a great host. She showed me around when I got in. All the little touches are great. There is a small fridge in the kitchen where you can put things. This was extremely handy. There are towels/toiletries, pen/paper/map/Mirrors/hangers/tv/radio/drawers/lamps etc in the bedroom. Everything youâ\\x80\\x99d get in a hotel. I donâ\\x80\\x99t usually stay in Airbnb so this was a pleasant surprise. The bed and pillow are super we comfy so I slept well. There is also an air con in the room. \\n\\nTracy allowed me to use the kitchen which was nice. As a tea addict it meant I can make a cup of tea when I like rather than going to Starbucks. The shower pressure is great. \\n\\nLocation is perfect. The place is about  5-7 mins walk to grand central/Madison garden & about 10-20 mins walk to Times Square if you know which way to go. Initially I made it long for myself by going round in circles but actually itâ\\x80\\x99s a long straight road down. Tons of shops/cafes/supermarket nearby. \\n\\nOnly downs- there isnâ\\x80\\x99t much natural light into the room as window is small. The bedroom sink pressure is low so takes forever to use. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a building with a lot of students & on two nights there were a lot of shouting & music outside my window as people partied in their balcony. Luckily I took earplugs which Iâ\\x80\\x99d advise. There was also loud water gushing noises coming from somewhere at night. I thought it was air con or tap but never did find out what it was- again earplugs come in handy. The bedroom door is difficult to open and close, itâ\\x80\\x99s really stiff & needs a bit of force \\n\\nOverall great experience & I loved the comfy room and cute kitchen. I would stay again! Tracyâ\\x80\\x99s place was perfect! Cosy and clean, and the bed was super comfortable. Location is great. Unfortunately didnâ\\x80\\x99t get to meet Tracy in person, but she was easy to contact and made me feel welcome. Would definitely stay again!\"),\n",

Garland's place worked well for our family.  It was great to experience life in a Brooklyn neighborhood. Es un apartamento muy cÃ³modo y confortable. La ubicaciÃ³n estÃ¡ muy bien cerca del metro y del autobÃºs. This was a great space for our family holiday. Lots of comfortable beds (4 queens, plus a fold-down couch), and very clean linens and space. The two bedrooms on each end of the apartment were air conditioned and the other rooms had fans, so we stayed comfortably cool in there despite the 85-90 degree very humid weather.  It is in an older New York building, and has not been significantly updated, which is what we expected so we were fine with that - felt like we were really experiencing New York! Staying in a residential middle-class neighbourhood added to that sense that we were getting a more authentic experience than a hotel would provide. The neighbourhood was great - we always felt safe, even coming home on the subway at midnight or 1am. The subways were very convenient and we could always get to where we wanted to go (mostly in Manhattan) - it usually took about 45 minutes with walking the three blocks to the station, waiting for the next train and then transferring to another to get us close to our destination. Lots of restaurants, coffee shops, etc. just a couple of blocks away, as well as a grocery store and liquor store, so everything you need is walking distance. We checked out the Dekalb Market Hall food market in Brooklyn, which was a short subway ride away, for lunch one day, and it was a fabulous selection of excellent food. \\n\\nJust the very basics were provided, including one towel per person and pretty minimal kitchen supplies. There is just a two-burner hot plate, as the gas stove is not hooked up. We wanted to eat out and experience all the wonderful food New York has to offer, so it generally wasn't a problem for us, but there was no toaster in the kitchen, which was our only disappointment with the unit because we were hoping to make quick breakfasts in before heading out for the day.\\n\\nMichael was a wonderful host. Very warm and helpful and quick to respond. He had lots of good tips for us about the neighbourhood and getting around.\\n\\nDefinitely made staying a few days in New York more affordable for our family group of seven people than we could ever get in a hotel, so would recommend it. We really liked the place. It is old but clean and has the nice charm of a typical Brooklyn apartment. We were a group of 6 and had plenty of room. The apartment has everything you need for a pleasant stay and is close to shops, bars and transportation. Mike, our host, was super responsive and very nice. He even offered an extra free day because our flights were delayed! The flat is very clean, cool furnitures and the beds are super. The check-in was easy and we had no problems with anything. Thank you, Mike.  Accueil chaleureux et rÃ©activitÃ© au rendez-vous. Appartement grand et confortable.\\nMetro Ã\\xa0 proximitÃ©.\\nTrÃ¨s bon sÃ©jour Ã\\xa0 New York  Garland and Mikeâ\\x80\\x99s place is an absolute dream for those traveling in a group. I visited for AfroPunk, with five other guest, and the space was the perfect size for us. Hearing stories about how small NYC apartments can be, I was surprised by all the space this location has. The air conditioning units kept the rooms cool at night, and the hot water never seemed to run low (again with six people in total). Mike, however, was an added bonus. He was flexible, communicative, and friendly.  The surrounding neighborhood of Crown Heights can seem a little seedy, however there is charm. Within walking distance there are fresh farm grocers, vegan restaurants, brunch hotspots, and cheap souvenir shopping. If Iâ\\x80\\x99m ever in Brooklyn again, I hope Mike is available. \\n\\nChicago kids love Brooklyn! Bien ubicado, si vives el ambiente de Brooklyn, si vas con personas mayores puede resultar cansado el subir las escaleras pero una vez dentro es confortable. There were a total of 6 of us traveling (3 couples) and felt that we all had a great deal of privacy when needed. A great surprise was finding that the bathroom was not inside of a room but rather in the hallway. One of the pictures looked like if it was in a room and we were a little worried about that. The beds were SO comfortable (very firm) and the surrounding neighborhood was very quiet. I would possibly recommend brining a spare  towel, one was provided per person but if you use one for your hair as well or are staying more than a few days you may want the extra.

Ronald's apartment was exactly as described. Situated at a prime location (walking distance from Rockefeller Centre, 5th Avenue and Central Park), freshly painted (!) and clean, it was a pleasure to come home to after a day in the city. We rented the place because of its size and location. Compared to other offers where apartments were most of the time located in the basement or groundfloor, this place on the 3rd floor has lots of natural light coming in. We really enjoyed this place and we thinks it is real value for money. But the major point is Ronald's availability.  We had a few issues during our stay which we communicated with him and at all times we had an answer within 10 minutes. That made our experience ever more delightful.

The apartment generally met our needs; however, we did feel it was a bit on the \"tired\" side and could use some freshening up in a couple of areas which we shared with the owner.  We do want to add that the communication with the owner was excellent and he went way out of his way to graciously accommodate our very late arrival (around mid-night) due to one of our flights being canceled and the need to rebook on a much later flight. The location was amazing! Everything was walking distance the bars and restaurants around were amazing. Would stay here every time I visit the city! Location, location, location! Within walking distance to Time square, Central Park, and excellent restaurants.  Don\\'t skip Mom\\'s! If you\\'re wanting to explore and experience NYC like a native this is a great start. Just remember this is an older home and thus comes with interesting character.'),\n",

Wi-Fi was fine for browsing; just donâ\\x80\\x99t expect to stream videos.  Great communication with the host Great little room. Close to everything. Shared bathroom. Quiet and quaint. Hayes is a friendly and welcoming host. He checked in with me from time to time to ensure that I was comfortable during my stay. The apartment is minutes walking distance to Atlantic Avenue-Barclay Centre station that is serviced by many many trains that can take you to most places in NYC. The check-in instructions were clear and my room was clean and well-presented when I arrived. The bed was comfortable. I had no issues whatsoever. Thank you Hayes for hosting me. The space is nice and essential, very good value for the position, super close to a subway stop that gets you pretty much anywhere. Hayes is a very good host, and turned out to be a friend (surprisingly enough, we also have friends in common) Hayes is a gem. Helpful, friendly and available. He is usually around the airbnb, so if you have a problem (which did not happen to me), you can go and see him.\\nAs for the room, it is just what you need.

Also some shelves were dusty. The worst thing was that bed sheets and towels were partly dirty and we found hair on it that was obviously not ours. \\n\\nOne day prior to our check out we got not a very nice message from the host that we didnâ\\x80\\x98t give back our keys. Although we got an excuse for that it left a bad feeling on our side. \\n\\nIt is quite loud in the bedroom during the night, but itâ\\x80\\x98s NYC so we didnâ\\x80\\x98t expect it to be super quiet. :)  In a great location, very clean and comfortable.

The location is nice and quiet, the only thing is that itâ\\x80\\x99s in East Harlem so the train lines are limited on that side, youâ\\x80\\x99ll need to\\nUber or walk, with stations a few blocks up or few blocks down if you want to get to West Harlem.

Very convenient location. Can catch a taxi in 15 seconds at west end avenue- a 30 sec walk from the place. The window ACs worked fine.

The neighborhood is very subway convenient and I quickly grew to feel safe walking home from the train late at night because neighbors were always hanging out on their porches and stoops late into the evening. If you're looking for a cheap, comfortable, well located place to stay in Brooklyn this place is what you're looking for. Takes about 25 minutes to get to from JFK, and costs around $30 in an uber. Its 5 minutes walking distance from 3 different stations so you can get to Manhattan any which way you like (I'd recommend the J train as you can see the Brooklyn bridge). It takes around 15 minutes to get to lower Manhattan and 35 to Times square, it's very close to Bushwick and Willamsburg, which were honestly the highlights of my trip. The room it's self is small but efficient, clean and the bed is very comfortable. Bathrooms could be cleaner but that's to expect in a budget airbnb. Overall would whole heartedly recommend and I imagine i'll be staying here again.  I do not recommend the stay, it does not answer the messages, the bathroom is dirty, the location is not good, there was a mouse in the kitchen. He did not speak to us for 6 days. It was a bad experience, I would like to cancel when I was there, but it was not possible. Great location.

To go to Central Park and other attractions you just have to walk two blocks to the subway station and in 20 minutes you are there. It is perfect for two or three people. \\nMy only big problem was that I found a mouse in the room and that's why I do not rate it as excellent. They also have to work in the refrigerator since it was throwing a lot of water and the floor got wet.

You can feel the positive energy that has put in towards building his family and his home. We felt very welcomed, very comfortable and at peace. Thank you Adonis.  What a sweet family! The accommodations were perfect for my son and I as we went to visit NYC and see some shows on Broadway. Apartment is on the second floor and is clean, larger than I expected, and very convenient to the NYC Ferry. Adonnis walked us upstairs and showed us around, pointed out cooking supplies and coffee, dry creamer as well as the WiFi setup. Home was perfect for our trip.  We absolutely loved staying here!  As other reviews stated, yes the bed is very comfortable. As one can tell from the map, it is not in the city, but the NYC Ferry is less than a 5 minute walk away and the subway station is a 10 to 15 minute walk. We had no issue with using either form of transportation. I would suggest using the (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps App as it will tell you what subway train or bus to take to get anywhere you want to go. There are stores within walking distance to stock up on any essentials or you can always use Uber or Lyft as well.  We walked from the subway station to the house at night and never felt unsafe.  It is a lovely, quiet neighborhood.  The host is absolutely great!  He was always available to answer questions and attend to any needs but at the same time gave ample space and privacy.  I cannot say enough great things about our stay and would definitely stay here again. it's a cozy location, spacious & a great host. I love that it had a TV& Keurig lol. needed it & got it lol. I'll be back next time I stay in Queens Great host. His place is simple yet outstanding. Safe area and a welcoming home Very good location, apartment and very nice host We stayed from August 7th to 9th 2018. The temperature was a very hot 420C if not hotter during the days we stayed but our accommodation was always a pleasantly cool place to rest and catch our breath. The extremely close proximity to the Astoria Ferry was a real selling point as well. Any of the stops brought you right into the MTA system. The street parking was competitive but once we found a spot, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t have to worry about it at all during our time there. \\nHaving used AirBNB directly and as part of a larger party previously, this host was absolutely what youâ\\x80\\x99d want: Delightful, downright friendly and eager to please. Whenever we had an issue, his extremely quick response time was one of the fastest Iâ\\x80\\x99ve experienced. His eagerness and competency to solve the issues were both comforting and impressive. We were treated very well and always with a smile attached to just a great positive attitude. It was my partnerâ\\x80\\x99s first time with AirBNB and our host made her experience better than what she was expecting. \\nWhat I always want in a place Iâ\\x80\\x99m staying is climate control, close proximity to mass transit and a host that wonâ\\x80\\x99t just let me fend for myself when things go sideways. This place ticks all those boxes and more. Iâ\\x80\\x99m very likely going to try to book this place again the next time around for sure.  Adonis was an amazing host, he was very accommodating and helpful. The bed was super comfortable as others have said and the apartment was clean and homey. Would definitely recommend staying here!  Adonis is the best host I've ever had on Airbnb. Stayed completely out of our hair but also readily around, available, and willing to answer any questions or help. Our flight from Addis Ababa was hugely delayed and I was unable to let him know until same day as arrival. He arranged for us to get into the apartment in the middle of the night and assured me not to worry that his job was to make things easier for us, not add to the stress of travel. Place is as described. We loved the proximity to the ferry, and Chateau le Woof (pet store & human cafe) across from the Socrates Sculpture Park. All we could ask for and more to sleep off some jet lag and house us for a couple days of work/play in the best city in the US of A. In NYC regularly. Will be staying at Adonis's place again. This place was okay.  Very short walk to the ferry to manhattan.  Only about 5 minutes.  The place does not have good air conditioning.  Entire apartment is being cooled by a window unit meant only for a bedroom or small room. It was really hot for all the days we were there and it was very hard to sleep.  If you were coming in the fall or winter I donâ\\x80\\x99t think it would be too bad but I would personally avoid the summer months.  We ending up leaving early due to the heat and the location just wasnâ\\x80\\x99t right for us.  Our host also began contacting us through phone calls instead of the air Bnb app and asked us for additional money, for the additional person who tagged along on our trip.  I didnâ\\x80\\x99t feel comfortable with the communication outside the app. This is a lovely apartment and Adonis was a very friendly host. Great place to stay! Primera experiencia en Airbnb y satisfactoria. El apartamento es tal como se describe y se ve en las fotos, ideal para una pareja.

This place is a scam! the minimum basic cleanliness is not provided. The appartment is poorly decorated with furniture so old that they've probably been thrown away somewhere.  There is a lot of missing light switch and the space reserved for that is empty, for some there plastic bags to fill. We did not have light in the living room for the entire stay. The dishwasher had died long time ago; and the hood was smelling. A total nightmare and very frustrating experience Awesome location with easy access to all of NY! Valeryâ\\x80\\x99s place is really awesome. Located in one of my favourite parts of the city her place was able to fit me and 5 of my friends very comfortably. The area around the place is full of bars and restaurant that are all very unique. Her apartment was practical and done the job very well. Absolutely a great location close to everything you need.  Great hiest & I will stay here again in the future.   Such an amazing spot! Two rooms, one with a bunk bed and the other with a large queen size bed. The living room has three couches that turn into futons and itâ\\x80\\x99s great that the place has its own washer and dryer! This is our 2nd time here and we will definitely be back! This is a very spacious extremely clean apartment in a great location. There are great restaurants in the area and it is very close to the subway station. I highly recommend staying here.\"),\n",

Close to the subway! Very nice and calm stay too. I enjoyed it! Joey was a good host and is great at communication. The place is a bit tight. With five rooms sharing two very tight bathrooms, the restrooms were often messy, ill equipped, and occupied. Location is good with the trains being a reasonable walk away. The room is small and cozy. If you have loud roommates you will hear them as the walls are a bit thin \\nWe lost our key and Joey was very responsive in providing a spare at no extra charge.  Decent place for the price. Ladies be aware of walking at night as men tend to hang outside and give looks. Close to subway to union square. The luncheonette place down the street was amazing for breakfast. Large bed that was pretty comfortable but was a little too big for the room. We brought one suitcase with us and had no place to put it. We were having to shift things around often just to make room for us. It's a good room if you're going out to the city all day and just need a place to sleep mostly. It was a good spot for our situation.  Clean, good price, close to transportation, and easy to check in ! Definitely will be back  Joey's place was solid. We had a private room with key + shared washroom/kitchen. Everything was clean and we never had any issues with other guests. Easy access to major subway lines into Brooklyn/Manhattan. The place is convenient. Close to the subway. Also like that the place has 2 bathrooms. Big bed, small space.\\nThe only thing we didnt like is too many people sharing it, it feels like a dormitory. One bathroom was a little dirty.\\nOverall, good stay. Nice place, comfy bed, and good location. Thanks Joey! Die Unterkunft liegt nah an der S-Bahn, was super war. Mir hat die Gegend super gefallen, kleine Cafes, Diner und SupermÃ¤rkte sind fuÃ\\x9flÃ¤ufig gut erreichbar. Der Check In war einfach. Die ZimmergrÃ¶Ã\\x9fe reicht, wenn man wirklich nur zum Schlafen da ist. Allerdings kann ich in Punktion Sauberkeit leider viele Bewertungen nicht nach vollziehen. WÃ¤hrend der 10 Tage war nur einmal eine Putzfrau da, die aber auch nur die MÃ¼lleimer geleert hat. Die Badezimmer wurden in der Zeit nicht einmal geputzt, was bei der Menge der Leute, die dort Ã¼bernachten durchaus mehr als fragwÃ¼rdig ist.\\n\\nAuch gab es da wohl Kommunikationsprobleme zwischen der Putzfrau und Joey und so kam ich zum AirBnB zurÃ¼ck und meine ZimmertÃ¼r stand sperrangelweit offen, obwohl ich sie verschlossen und abgeschlossen verlassen hatte. Dazu hatte sie noch eine TÃ¼te mit Lebensmitteln weg geschmissen, die nicht einmal in der NÃ¤he des MÃ¼lleimers stand. Gott sei Dank war alles andere noch da. Joey hat auch sofort auf meine Nachrichten reagiert, aber fÃ¼r mich ist sowas leider ein No Go.\\n\\nDie KÃ¼che ist wie schon oft beschrieben wirklich maximal dafÃ¼r geeignet einen Tee zu kochen. Teller und Besteck wÃ¤ren durchaus sinnvoll.\\n\\nAlles in Allem war es in Ordnung, ich kenn es schlimmer, allerdings auch bei Weitem besser. Lacked some basics like a bathroom mat / towel, so the bathroom floor became soaked after showering. Also no hand towel in the bathroom for drying hands. A bedroom lamp would be nice as the overhead light is quite harsh. Overall good though, about what I expected.\"),\n",

The host mike is very friendly and was quick to respond to my messages. I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe you can find a better spot in Brooklyn. Mikeâ\\x80\\x99s a great host. Communicates quickly, and he was there to greet me and give me a run-down of the property. The apt is spacious and is a good place for one or two people. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a couch for a guest. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve stayed in many AirBnBs, some very well kept and clean, and some not so much. This one was right in the middle. The location/neighborhood is somewhat transitional (not the most scenic part of Brooklyn), but itâ\\x80\\x99s convenient.  It is a good single bedroom apartment  Me and my sister stayed at Mike's place and fell in love with it. It is a modern style condo, yet the accent brick wall and elevator which goes directly into the space gives it a pleasant vintage New York feel. We were skeptical about the elevator at first but there is absolutely nothing to worry about. Mike explained prior to booking how it worked and there is no access to the apartment without your key, so it's completely safe. The apartment was spacious especially for New York. Mike's place was equipped with an entertainment system, cable tv with smart apps, books, cooking pots and pans so you don't always have to eat out, and he was even nice enough to stock the fridge with water bottles and a welcome bottle of wine. The bathrooms were clean and stocked with extra towels and toiletries, and the water pressure in the shower was amazing. Mike was there to welcome us and show us around the apartment, he was very easy to reach and extremely accommodating, he's really a great Host! The neighbourhood has a lot of grocery stores, restaurants, and shops just a short walk away, and was pretty safe, we had no issues walking around at night together. There's also a really great park close by called Fort Greene Park. Transportation to the city was pretty simple, we took the bus to the train station and the train took us straight into Manhattan or you can also avoid the bus and walk a few  mins to the nearest station. The apartment was also very close to downtown Brooklyn which has lots of great restaurants and an outdoor mall called Fulton Mall. We enjoyed our stay and plan to book this place for all our New York visits. Thank you Mike! What an ideal place to stay in New York. It has the charm of Brooklyn and easy proximity to NYC. The neighborhood is a quiet tree lined street that is a short walk to many shops and restaurants. The apartment itself is spacious and full of light with lots of big windows. I particularly loved the small balcony where I could enjoy my coffee in the morning and a glass of wine in the evening. The whole place was clean and welcoming.  Mike is a great host. He showed me around when I arrived and responded to my questions promptly.  I will certainly be recommending this spot to all my friends and family who come to New York.

This location was super excellent for going out to bars and for great restaurants. We loved stopping at the Union market  right next door for some snacks and coffee. There was some noise from the bar downstairs in the evening but we were out until past the bar closed so we didn't mind! Earplugs would probably suffice for a light sleeper.  Easy with communication and the set-up for the keys is easy. Good place ! I wish I could tell everyone about David's place, but my husband and I didn't make it that far.  We received the initial instructions with the address and how to get the key.  Three hours before we made it into NY I asked for recommendations on parking with no response.  I understand it was the middle of the day and I thought we could just figure it out.  We parked near the location provide, took out our luggage (since you can't go back to your car in NY parking garages), and made our way to the address.  The address provide didn't exist and we stared at a boarded up building.  So I went to get the key while my husband at on the street with all of our luggage.  When I went to get the key the system was acting up and the employees at the grocery store said there was no way for me to get the key.  During this time I had called, text, and written David on Airbnb message system with no response.  We waited for an hour and a half on the streets before feeling like we had been scammed, went to a hotel, and called customer service.  Once customer service contacted David, he then contacted me with the info that included the true address because the one he sends isn't the correct one.  Why does he do this? I don't know.  By this time it was too late.  We waiting 1.5 hours, walked a mile with our luggage, and around checked into the hotel.  The reasoning for this was that his phone was off because he was at work.  I understand that, but if this is the way he runs his Airbnb, directions should've been sent much earlier so we didn't have to go through this mess.  I would like to say Airbnb customer service did a great job with helping us through the situation and making it as less stressful as possible after you think you've been scammed.

       "  'Excellent place to stay. Thank you very much It was a cozy room. Kristin was so nice. Kristian and Damien were great hosts and very flexible. Cool little space with privacy and great location. Great value for the price. Kristin was very kind and easy to communicate with. The location and patio were also great. However my girlfriend and I had to share the place with four other people at one time which made it feel cramped, especially the bathroom situation. One bathroom for six people had us waiting a lot. Also, the bedroom is in the basement and was quite dark and not as good as I was expecting. This booking was a HUGE deception for us. It was so bad that we had to call Airbnb help center & book another place as an emergency....I had been to dozens of Airbns before with great experiences and this had never happened. 1/ The description of this listing is dishonest. It is NOT at all a \"cozy bedroom\". It is a tiny room in the basement, humid, gloomy and dirty (didnt even bother to clean it apparently), where Kristin just put a bed. The door does not lock (you can open it with any key) and was open every time we have been there (anyone could just enter the place). I am seriously wondering whether many of the other reviews she has are not fake reviews (from very new members...). I would not let anyone sleep in that \"room\". And it was very dirty! 2/ Bad host. For the check in, she tells us we have to wait until 7:30pm (we had arrived early with luggage and I had told her so) or go somewhere in NYC at her work to get the keys. Luckily enough I found a friend to help us with the luggage for the day.  3/ We stayed very courteous with her but I do not think she should be on Airbnb.

The deli downstairs is an excellent place to get a quick affordable breakfast and the proprietor, Singh couldn't be nicer. The apartment was very clean, spacious by Manhattan standards, and absolutely perfectly located for access to uptown museums, the park, and the A and C lines downtown. The street was quiet. A perfect rental for our families. We'll be back.  Really nice place. We slept 7 very comfortably. Each room has its own air conditioning. Only 1 block from bus and subway. Very safe area with a great little coffee shop below. Shay connected with me everyday via email to check to see if we needed anything. The apartment was great - just as advertised. You do have to be able to climb 2 sets of very steep and narrow stairs however.\\nThat said, the communication with the hosts could hardly have been worse. We were even given a completely wrong address! This place was phenomenal! The pictures are very accurate! The place is very clean, the rooms are nice, having two bathrooms were a plus and the location is outstanding! The host communicated well and responded rapidly.

We felt complete at home at the apartment, close to everything we wanted to see. Also itâ\\x80\\x99s un a fantastic location, specially for a family. Fantastic for museum days and two blocks from Zabarâ\\x80\\x99s! Thank you to our hosts for a memorable experience! The space is clean, and very comfortable. We stayed with 4 adults and 2 young children and it provided us with enough room so that we weren't tripping over each other. The pictures are very accurate to what you get, it's not a giant place, but it is big for New York. Literally right next to Central park, and the Natural history museum. Tons of restaurants and things nearby and easy access to public transit.  Be warned that the stairs are quite steep, even getting to the first floor is a trek up about 2 flights worth of stairs.

Clean, the bedroom is on the other side of the apartment from Ron (so you can interact if you like, can work if you need to). There is a small table if you need to work. Easy to find. Has a positive vibe. Location is perfect (I was working late, and having a dinner at midnight wasn't an issue). I don't use Airbnb a lot anymore because I had several far from perfect experiences, sense of privacy being the main issue. This is not the case here. I wish Ron all the best! Ron was very accommodating and helpful, especially with our late check in. The check in process was very easy and Ron's instructions were a breeze. \\n\\nThe Airbnb was extremely clean, private, comfortable, and recently renovated. Although we were sharing the space with Ron, it felt separated, especially with how close the bathroom is to the guest room where we were staying. We didn't use any of the appliances but everything looked like it was in good shape.\\n\\nThe room itself was very quiet (which I was surprised about considering you're right in the thick of NYC), well-maintained, and had everything we needed including space for our bags, a comfortable bed, a large TV, and air conditioning.\\n\\nThe location was perfect. Within short walking distance you have many restaurants of all kinds; tourist attractions like Times Square, Grand Central Station, the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Centre and more; many theatres big and small; and subway stations.\\n\\nOverall it was a great few days in NYC and we will definitely consider Ron's place for our next trip. Just perfect! The location was fantastic and Ron is an awesome guy! Great host, great place! The location is good. It is just a couple blocks to get to some of the main sights.

The 2d bed worked out great for my mom and me. Everything was available or if something was needed, Michelle responded quickly to our requests. Effective communication for sure ((: My friend and I had a wonderful three night stay in the \"Spacious Guestroom\". Michelle and her husband were quick to jump to our needs and requests.

Hier und da ein Pinsel Farbe und etwas Ordnung, schon wÃ¼rde es ganz anders aussehen. \\nAber was uns am meisten gestÃ¶rt hat war, dass das Gemeinschaftsbad nicht regelmÃ¤Ã\\x9fig gereinigt wurde.

Allerdings auf dem Weg von der Metro zum Zimmer  New York Av und Kingston Ave haben wir uns doch unwohl gefÃ¼hlt. Auf dem RÃ¼ckweg von einen Eishockeyspiel hat man uns  in der Strasse wo das Zimmer war etwas zu Rauchen angeboten.\\nLeider fanden wir im Vorfeld die Kommunikation mit dem Gastgeber nicht gut. Wir wollten unter anderem noch das kleine Zimmer fÃ¼r einen Freund dazu buchen und bei Fragen dazu und anderen Fragen kam immer die selbe Standardantwort \" I will send you detailed check-in instructions 48 hours before check-in.\"    \\n\\nWas wir so ein bisschen vermisst haben war in der Checkin Mail \"was das Taxi vom Flughafen kosten darf, wie man am Besten in die Stadt kommt, Umgebungstips\" etc. \\n\\nTip von uns: schrÃ¤g links vom Haus fÃ¤hrt alle paar Minuten der Bus M44, kann mit der Metrokarte gefahren werden, nach 4 Stationen ist man an der Metrostation Nostrand Av, dort mit der \"A\" nach Manhatten fahren, das ist ein Expresszug und man ist viel schneller als mit Line 3,4 in Manhatten. Wenn man mit der M44 bis zur Nostrand Av fÃ¤hrt, dort in den M25 steigt, fÃ¤hrt dieser einen bis zum Brooklyn Bride Park. man kommt so bequem zur Brooklyn Bridge und sieht noch was von Brooklyn.\\nWir freuen uns schon auf den nÃ¤chsten Besuchen in NY, allerdings wohl in einer anderen Unterkunft.'),\n",

Jorge and his wife are incredibly lovely - they were super friendly and attentive, and made sure the place was fully stocked with everything we could need. The apartment itself is so pretty, with beautiful, brand-new looking bathroom and kitchen, a super cozy and stylish atmosphere, and even a cute patio out back. The only thing to note is that the ceilings are a bit low, so not ideal for taller people. But otherwise, I would totally recommend this place for anyone looking to stay in Brooklyn! While the location is not the most central, it's really easy to get into lower Manhattan from there by subway, and other Brooklyn areas like Williamsburg are close by too. I loved this experience and would happily stay here again. Jorge and Ana are on a straight path to be superhosts and easily made it into our list of unforgettable hosts. They are very welcoming and kind. You can feel they really care about their guests. You'll get a welcome kit (local guides, snacks and beverages -ours got wine included!); a clean, modern, fully equipped, carefully decorated basement; a charming patio included; fluid communication from the moment you book; and last but not least: their (almost) 24/7 attention and help. The place is exactly as in the pics, even better I'd say. You have everything for a 2-3 people comfortable stay, with all kitchen utensils and extra linens. This part of Brooklyn is also an experience in itself: a safe, diverse spot, filled with local delis, bars and multiple subway stops on walkable distance. They even offer water for stray cats! Totally recommended! Anaâ\\x80\\x99s & Jorgeâ\\x80\\x99s Apartment ist just perfect for days in Brooklyn. The area is super nice, cool Bars, vintage Shops und Streetart, especially the Bushwick Collective.

The apartment is clean and comfy, Jorge & Ana even had welcome snacks and drinks for us which was so nice.

They did a very good job getting the place up to par. It can be compared to one of the nicest hotel rooms in NYC. \\n\\nThe neighborhood seems somewhat unsafe and if I was wrong, there wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be bars on the windows. (Unless itâ\\x80\\x99s a New York thing like in parts of Florida.) I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t feel safe walking alone at night. \\n\\nI had to park on the street because the driveway I was told, is for tenants. Parking is scarce. The parking spot I found was not visible from the apartment. \\n\\nWhen I arrived the neighbors in front a few doors down, were performing mechanical repairs on the street. \\n\\nThereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing here that is at a reasonable walking distance, so be ready to Uber or drive everywhere. But if you do the latter, you may not find a parking spot when you return. \\n\\nPros- The photos tell no lies. The place is very nice. \\n-Convenient location to the airport\\n-Adesola is very responsive\\n-Free WiFi \\n-Good for the price\\n-Very clean \\n-Full kitchen \\n\\nCons- Tenants upstairs can be noisy. One can hear almost everything. I had to get up early the next day and at almost 11pm, the upstairs noise thumping sound was loud. Not even the air conditioner noise could suppress it. \\n-Nothing close by to get something to eat or to go sightseeing. Ubereats is a must here or bring your own food. \\n-Bars on windows \\n-No fire alarms \\n-No central air conditioner (portables are used) \\n-Parking is not readily accessible (would be better if you are arriving by Uber/taxi  and not driving your POV here.)\\n- Not so great looking neighborhood. \\n- In person, you deal mostly with her young son, as Adesola seems somewhat uncomfortable communicating in English.\\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m not sure Iâ\\x80\\x99d stay here again. Not because of the room and hostess, (they were both very nice) but because of the neighborhood and the noise from the upstairs neighbor.

       "  \"Very clean place.\\nConvenient location, close to subway and stores. Wonderful experience! Everything was clean and tidy, the apartment was relatively easy to find, and just a few minutes walk to the nearest subway station! Loved staying here and would definitely recommend! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We loved making use of the free MoMa entry and enjoyed coming home to aircon and a stylish apartment at the end of a hot day in New York. The apartment is very close to the subway which made getting around easy and Heeran is very prompt in her communication. Would definitely recommend this place to friends.  El apartamento es tal cual aparece en las fotos. Perfecto para 2 personas si no quieres gastarte mucho dinero en visitar Nueva York. Esta bien comunicado, tiene el metro a 2 min y 2 lÃ\\xadneas de metro que te comunican con el centro aunque estÃ¡ un poco alejado de este pero no se tarda mucho en llegar. El Barrio es un poco raro pero seguro y no es muy ruidoso. En cuanto a Heeram no coincidimos con ella pero siempre nos ha dado facilidades y ha estado pendiente de nosotros en todo momento por si necesitÃ¡bamos algo. En resumen, si quieres venir a Nueva York y gastar poco pero estar bien comunicado te recomiendo este apartamento.  As our first experience with airbnb, we were skeptical, but Heeran proved us wrong with her shared room in her appartement. Even if we were living with other guests, we had the intimacy we needed, the place was clean and nice. I personally didn't think the neighborhood was loud even thought people in the comments say otherwise. I recommend her place for sure, she was flexible with check-ins and check-outs... Ty very much from Montreal!  Great space, Heeran is a very nice hostess and me and my friend greatly enjoyed our stay. We really enjoyed our stay at Heeranâ\\x80\\x99s. The apartment was comfortable and clean. A comfortable walk to the Metro line. The kitchen was well-equipped. Too bad we didnâ\\x80\\x99t get to meet Heeran during our stay but we did exchange messages quite often and she came back to us immediately. I would definitely stay again!  It was an awesome stay, thank you so much! â\\x9d¤ï¸\\x8f Heeranâ\\x80\\x99s place is great. Itâ\\x80\\x99s clean and everything works. Location is good and subway is right around the corner. Heeran is a great and kind host and takes care of everything. Good value for your money!  The hospitality is amazing to say the least along with being extremely  clean. Heeran streamlined pretty much everything! Public transportation is really accessible from this place Everything is as you might expect except for the outdated photos and the warm living room. Heeran is a very nice host and extremely accommodating. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll definitely consider her place again when Iâ\\x80\\x99m back in Brooklyn. Wir waren fÃ¼r eine Woche GÃ¤ste in Heeran's Unterkunft. Die Kommunikation im Vorfeld war super und der Self Check-in hat bestens geklappt. Die Einrichtung der Wohnung hat uns sehr gut gefallen. Alles war sauber und ordentlich. Da wir bei unserem Besuch sehr heiÃ\\x9fes Wetter hatten, waren wir froh dass die Zimmer Ã¼ber eine Klimaanlage verfÃ¼gten. Die Wohnung liegt direkt an einer Subway Station und ein Supermarkt ist nur 5 Gehminuten entfernt. Da die Wohnung direkt an einer stark befahrenen StraÃ\\x9fe liegt und dort viele Busse fahren, kann man die GerÃ¤usche in der Wohnung sehr laut wahrnehmen. Dies ist vor allem nachts etwas stÃ¶rend. Aber in der Beschreibung wird ja im Vorfeld darauf hingewiesen. Man sollte sich eventuell Ohropax mitnehmen. \\nDie anderen GÃ¤ste und Mitbewohner waren sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Es gab keinerlei Probleme. \\nZusammengefasst kÃ¶nnen wir diese Wohnung definitiv weiter empfehlen - gerade wegen der guten Anbindung zur Subway. \\n \\nDanke fÃ¼r alles Heeran :-) Heeran's apartment was exactly what I needed for my trip. Great place! We had a great stay at Heeran's place and would come back anytime. It was clean, the beds were comfortable and we just enjoyed everything about it. Thanks! Super clean and lovely home! Heeran was an excellent communicator - answered all my questions as fast as possible, regardless of how late I sent a message. I would absolutely come back.\"),\n",

Itâ\\x80\\x99s a 1 bedroom w/ 2 futon like couches in the living room so perfect for 4-6 people. He communicated rapidly. It was not super fancy but the kitchen and bathroom were well stocked w/ bonus things you may need during your stay (my daughter loved the fun size chocolate bars-thanks!). We had issues w/ the WiFi which we couldnâ\\x80\\x99t get to work and he came by to fix the TV. The bathroom  shower drain was an issue which we finally resolved by removing the clogged filter.  Please beware that itâ\\x80\\x99s a 3rd floor walk up (47 steps) which wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a problem for me but was hard on my 78 year old mother who stayed with us. All in all we had a pleasant stay and couldnâ\\x80\\x99t beat the location of the apartment for our needs! Iâ\\x80\\x99d stay there again the next time Iâ\\x80\\x99m in NYC. This place is everything and then some! The space is very New York and very comfortable. The location is prime especially if you want to for New York experience without having all hassle and over crowdedness of the tourist scene. The best part about this place is probably the host. Andreas will go above and beyond to make sure that your stay is the best possible! This is the only reason, but it is definitely a big reason why we keep staying with him! I could not of asked for a better place! And I cannot wait to return. Many thanks for all the amazing comforts and amenities provided to my wife and I on our stays! Looking forward to our next visit! Great place and perfect location.  Andreas responded immediately to all of our questions.  We loved this place and we definitely recommend it and would stay here again.  Andrea is an awesome host. Great location. The kitchen is full of awesome stuff for us to use. The kids love the freeze pop. Well definitely recommend to other people. We had a great week at Andreasâ\\x80\\x99 place. The location was amazing (so close to the Subway, a Duane Reade and grocery stores), and it was nice staying on the more residential UWS. The space was more than adequate for our family since our two kids under 10 didnâ\\x80\\x99t mind sleeping on the futons in the living room. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a 3rd floor walk up, but there are working A/C  units in the apartment so you can cool off after the hike. We loved staying here! Great place! Thank you for the hospitality.  Andreas was very helpful during my stay. The location is perfect. Recommend.  Andreas is a very responsive host which was much appreciated. The place is located close to public transit, museums, cafes, etc. We had a great visit!  We enjoyed staying at your lovely, cozy home. Great upper West Side location! Clear check-in instructions and communication during the stay. This place is close to everything (subway is a block away,  tons of amazing local restaurants and coffee shops, food markets and drug stores are all within 5 min walk)\\nCentral Park, museums and movie theater are all in walking distance.\\nThis place has perfect location and great  NY charm! Andreas was a responsive and helpful host! My fiancÃ© and I stayed at Andreasâ\\x80\\x99s place in the upper west side and we had a wonderful time. \\n\\nAndreas was always quick to respond and helped accommodate our fairly late arrival and having to stow our bags if needed on our departure date\\n\\nThe apartment is small but functional and  charming. Itâ\\x80\\x99s clean and has everything one would need. Itâ\\x80\\x99s situated in the heart of the upper west side in a quaint and beautiful neighborhood a short two block walk from the 1, 2 and 3 subway lines. Itâ\\x80\\x99s also just a couple blocks from Central Park and the area is filled with wonderful little cafes, restaurants and bars.\\n\\nMuseums are just a short ride from the apartments location as is almost everything else via subway.\\n\\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our experience and canâ\\x80\\x99t wait to come back! Andrea's is a great host and his Apt. is fantastic!  It is located on the Upper West Side,  in a wonderful neighborhood with great restaurants, Whole Foods and Trader Joes close by as well as little bodegas open late where you can get almost anything you need.\\n\\nThe apt. is very comfortable and clean, with a full size refrigerator and very comfortable bed. Andreas is always available by phone or text to answer any questions you may have.\\nThe check in was very easy and the buidling and street that the apt is on is very quiet.\\nI felt very relaxed and comfortable. It was a great place to come home to after a full day of meetings.\\nAndreas was also very helpful in letting me know about good restaurants etc in the neighborhood.\\nThere are quite a few stairs to get to the apt, so that's important to know in case that's an issue for you. \\nI have stayed in many Air BNB's in NYC and this is definitely one of the best I've ever stayed in. My husband and I had a very pleasant and smooth 11-day stay at Andreas' place.  The space was spacious and had everything we needed; everything worked; wifi was reliable; kitchen well-equipped with lots of extras; there was plenty of hot water for showers. In the middle of our stay with an additional guest, Andreas kindly reached out to find out if more linens were needed.  The location of this place is extremely convenient for trains, buses, and both Central and Riverside Parks.  Communications with Andreas were instant and friendly.  We would definitely stay here again.  Highly recommended! Andreaâ\\x80\\x99s is very accommodating and a great communicator! His place is super cute and has a great location just minutes from Central Park and the subway station. As a first timer in NY, it was an excellent first experience! Highly recommend.\"),\n",

Michelle has a very cute place in Chelsea that is amazingly close to Penn Station, The High Line, West Village, etc. We had an amazing time visiting the neighborhood. The apartment is decorated in a wonderful cute way that really highlights all that New York has to offer. Great location. Fast check in and check out.  Host was very responsive and helpful about picking up the keys which was a first for me. Place was very centrally located in Chelsea and easy to access to Penn Station without the area been too busy. Great for a couple look for refuge after a weekend exploring the city. While Michelle was great and communicative, the building is in dire need of a renovation. The apartment itself, though not too small for New York, was not clean and quite old. We faced cleanliness issues (multiple hair on the sheets etc) in the bathroom and bedroom which made the stay a bit uncomfortable. The laundry room was a disaster with the limited machines either broken or so filthy that it was impossible to wash clothes in them. There was a slow fan in the bedroom which didnâ\\x80\\x99t help keep us cool during our stay as it was quite hot. The air conditioner in the sitting area wasnâ\\x80\\x99t too effective either. \\nThe location is decent and easy to find. All in all, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I would stay here again.

Vinicio was great at staying in touch and always responded really quickly, including finding help for me quickly when the bedroom door got jammed! Very comfy bed, good shower, decent wifi. The host was very friendly and the communication was outstanding. The apartment was very clean when we arrived and it was a quiet spot in this busy town.

I would stay here again. Spectacular roof terrace. Couch, table and chairs, bar and grill. Great location. Lots within walking distance and two metros close to apt. We walked to Williamsburg in about 30 mins. Bushwick collective 15 mins away. Like another reviewer mentioned, the photos do not do apartment justice. Large, bright modern space. Spotlessly clean.

       "  'Excellent place and price.  We had a lovely stay in Brooklyn. The apartment provided lots of space to decompress and for our kids to recharge. It was perfect having the subway right there and there were a number of great coffee shops right nearby. We visited during a bit of a heat wave and as someone who grew up with east coast summers I was impressed at how well the air conditioners kept everything cool and comfortable. The kitchen was well-equipped which let us make breakfast there before heading out for the day. The location was perfect and the host did not take any time to respond. The stay was perfectly suited for our family. The only downside was the rooms were little compact. Overall I can rate this as one of my better experiences. Excellent place to stay. Very close to the metro which made things very easy. Kirikoâ\\x80\\x99s husband was extremely reactive. The access to the apartment was very easy. Not need for keys, a simple code at the door. Excellent system especially when youâ\\x80\\x99re a big group. The flat was big and comfortable, very clean. We had an excellent stay! The location was great. One block from the subway and we found on street parking 3 blocks away. I appreciated the communication with the owners, very quick responses to any questions I had. They offered to make the entrance code something I could remember, which was very helpful after a long day of sightseeing. The apartment was very clean. We would have liked to have a top sheet on the bed, but it was ok. There were air conditioners in the front and back of the apartment and a fan in the middle to help circulate the air. A great place to stay! Dominic and Kirikoâ\\x80\\x99s place was clean, quiet, and slept 5 people very comfortably. Dominic was very responsive and checked in with us frequently. We very much enjoyed our stay! O apartamento Ã© muito bom e bem localizado. Tem tudo para uma boa estadia de 6 ou 7 pessoas, mas lembre-se que tem apenas um banheiro. O metrÃ´ e bastante prÃ³ximo e deixa em Manhattan em 20 a 40 minutos (dependendo de onde vocÃª quer ir). O Brooklyn Ã© um bairro bem simpÃ¡tico. Recomendo! great place! Staying at home was a great time. we felt very comfortable, everything lived up to expectations. The host were very helpful when we asked any questions and quickly responded to the news. The only inconvenience was the connection by subway. Are lines 2 and 5. \\n5 is an express which is fast, but during a 10-day stay, we only hit it 3 times and the line 2 local that went down to lower manhattan 40 min and return from the upper one more than an hour, late at night it was tiring. Time we remember very well and with a smile we would like to return to your apartment. Thank you again for all and best regards. An unpretentious, basic apartment with a perfect location! Train is around the the corner and Nostrand Ave is the next block over. Will take about (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) mins to get to Manhattan fyi.\\n\\nBeing able to use wifi/ (Hidden by Airbnb) was a nice touch as well as not having to carry a key ( keyless entry)'),\n",

       "  \"Nneka and Brenda have been great hosts who responded really fast and were really helpful. The room is exactly as described, no surprises.  The place is also very spacious, enough to also fit an air mattress.  Overall, this has been a great experience for my family and I would definitely recommend this place!  As advertised, Nneka's place is conveniently situated within steps of the Barclay Center, Prospect Park, and quite a few eateries if you're into food.  The space is large, has fashionable decor, and is very affordable compared to other hotels in the area! Besides going up and down rigidity steps to get to the bathroom and a leaky air mattress, this play is a good stay for visiting New York City on a budget! Beautiful and spacious apartment. The hosts were very accommodating and we loved the character of the neighborhood and building. Especially for the rate! I stayed in this HUGE apartment for one night on a flying visit to NYC - it was incredibly easy to find (I did already know the area) keys were waiting for me in a lockbox - and communications was great considering how late I booked. I suffer with noise sweetness during the night, aside from the odd creaking floor board it was very quiet. No street noise etc. Incredibly clean - you do share a bathroom with the other tenant (who resides in a completely separate space - apt is self contained) this concerned me at first but it was immaculate and I never saw another soul the whole time I was there. No kitchen as such - microwave and fridge with coffee maker. Not a problem as there are amazing Resteraunt's 2mins away on foot and a supermarket across the road. The kitchen setup was clear in the listing so not a surprise. Would highly recommend  The pictures do not do justice to the amazing woodwork in the apartment.  The decor is restrained, nicely punctuating the two large rooms.  The bathroom is shared and is in the basement.  Rowhouses look narrow from the outside but the high ceilings and tall windows more than make up for it inside.  This location is close to at least two CitiBike hubs, which we recommend for getting around the neighborhood.  Lots of interesting shops & cafes nearby, nice hosts onsite, and quiet street.   The location is ideal!! Great space and value! I recently stayed here the previous week and decided to book again for three nights. I was only disappointed I couldn't stay a full week as they were booked that's how popular it is - it was incredibly easy to find (I did already know the area) keys were waiting for me in a lockbox - and communications was great considering how late I booked. I suffer with noise sweetness during the night, aside from the odd creaking floor board it was very quiet. No street noise etc. Incredibly clean - you do share a bathroom with the other tenant (who resides in a completely separate space - apt is self contained) this concerned me at first but it was immaculate and I never saw another soul the whole time I was there.

It is close to Barclay Center and numerous trains. The neighborhood is incredibly cute! Has tons of  restaurants and bars and coffee shops! \\n\\nNneka was incredibly accommodating allowed us to check in a little before official check in time. The self check in process was really simple and straight forward. In addition Nneka allowed us to leave out luggage downstairs after we checked our so that wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have to lug it around the city until our flights! \\n\\nWould 100% recommend and would 100% stay again!  Beautiful, spacious, and clean apartment! The hosts were kind, and check-in is easy (self check-in with helpful and easy to follow directions). Would highly recommend!  Great place in a great location. Host explained everything for a smooth check in/check out. The room was spacious and clean. Iâ\\x80\\x99d recommend to a friend who wants to stay in Park Slope in the future! Great place in a great neighborhood close to lots of amazing food and easy access to the city  Very simple flat in a very old row house. Elegant woodwork, quiet neighborhood. Cute brownstone in outstading location. Walking distance to little shops and restaurants. Nneka was very accommodating and let us drop off our luggage before check in! She also responds back in a timely manner if you have any questions . Would definately recommend! Definitely an amazing place to stay for those that are looking to live like a local and explore new york. It's a quick walk to the Union St Station or Barclays and Lafayette. And super easy to go out and grab some food as there are a variety of different restaurants, local deli's and grocery shops around the area. Definitely an amazing experience! And it was definitely a pleasure to stay in one of these brownstone homes!\"),\n",

The love and effort that was put into this Place was very apparent. Much larger apt than we thought. We expected it to be cleaner as there was a noticeable amount of dust under the bed and couch and kitchen counters seemed a bit less than wiped down. But sheets and towel were all clean and nice. The bedroom is right above a busy street so it is usually loud but I guess itâ\\x80\\x99s loud everywhere is nyc lol. Lots of trash and trash cans on the street by the entry door so we were not crazy about the location even though it was safe and close to everything. But the apartment is beautiful and Sam was very easily reached and worked with us through anything we needed so it was still an amazing trip.  Really excellent stay here, location is phenomenal and the neighborhood is so much fun. Super easy to get to Manhattan or anywhere in Brooklyn.

Even when the apartment is in a really good spot in the city, in the late night seems to be dirty but only some blocks, and of course this is not Chris fault, this is just an advice so you do not think that everything around is like that because if you walk 2 blocks to Amsterdam or Central Park everything is perfect. Again, Thanks Chris for all what you did, it was a real pleasure to met you. Thank you for everything we have prepared, Chris is a very kindly and friendly people. The apartment that is very convenient for transportation. And have a kitchen that we can use it. It's a Nice experience! I stayed in Chris' room for two nights for a work event at Yankee Stadium. It was one of the more affordable options in City that I was able to find and relative to the cost, it provides great value. In terms of the quality of the amenities, what you get inside reflects the price. The one slight issue we experienced was fireworks getting let off by neighbors on the street our first night there. \\n\\nBut the real value is the accessibility of location. There is a subway stop less than a block away so the whole city is at your finger tips. If you are driving, finding street parking is very easy. I unfortunately did not have the chance to take advantage of the proximity to Central Park which another great selling point for Chris' place. \\n\\nOn the whole, Chris is a great host - very responsive and accommodating in coordinating check in and made us feel very welcome and like it was our home.

There's also a private feel inside the apartment as the host does not get in your personal space. I would highly recommend this place. Great place my girlfriend and I had a great anniversary!  It wasn't a bad stay necessarily, but it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a great stay. I think there are a lot of very positive reviews - so a more honest review would have made me go into the stay with appropriate expectations. \\n\\nFrom what I got from staying there the entire home is for air bnb rental, and similar to a hostel setting. In the reviews people say that itâ\\x80\\x99s a 5min walk to the train. They must be walking very very fast because the closest train station is at least a 10-15 minute walk. The positive is that there is a variety of trains around you, itâ\\x80\\x99s just a bit of a walk depending on which train you want to take. \\n\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s a very easy check in process. The key code is very easy to use and the key is in the lock waiting for you. The room has everything you need, and we had a room with a washroom which was great. There is a comfortable bed, desk, mirror, and air conditioning. My only gripe was the room felt dirty. It was really dusty and had hair balls on the floor. \\n\\nThe kitchen is a communal space. It was nice that we got to have full access to the kitchen. \\n\\nOur communication with this air bnb was pretty much non-existent, and we did not meet her. She seems like a nice person but I messaged her once throughout the trip for details about the space and I got no response. \\n\\nI wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t recommend this air bnb to single female travellers especially walking around late at night. I feel like I would have felt very uncomfortable if I was alone. There is a home next to the air bnb where people hang out at all hours of the day and night and itâ\\x80\\x99s not the most comfortable walking by it. \\n\\n The place was great! I would definitely book again! Here is a totally honest review about this place. We never met our host in person, however they were polite and responsive anytime we had an issue- always replied quickly. That's about all I can say for the experience. The room locked (although the doorknob is a makeshift rope) and had nice air conditioning by the bed. The cleanliness appears fine upfront, but we found bugs in the shower and kitchen sink each day. Had some minor but annoying bites by the end of the trip. It sucks that this place is advertised as a rather private place, but it's literally a hostel. We were surprised to find another couple staying in the room right next to us, and by the looks on their faces they were just as surprised to find us. The borough is, put lightly, not a pleasant place to walk around at night. Not to mention the incredibly loud next door neighbors who sit outside and blast super loud music all day and night. It's a $50 room at best. My advice would be, if you can, throw down the extra $30 and get a place in a different borough. We loved it spacious area's our room was clean and bright we were ab it dubious about the area but everyone was helpful  with directions we would go back :) The place is great, very clean and Shad helped us find place for keeping luggage when our flight was delayed.

The home was exceptionally clean and very accurate to the images. I ended up staying longer :) I will definitely be back again ! Mariam was very quick to respond and welcoming. The self check in process was    simple and I appreciated the thoughtfulness; clean bedding, welcome candy, extra towel and bath slippers. The AC came in handy for the humid summer weather. The space is lovely, I loved all the little corners filled with books, movies and board games. I appreciated the tv options (Hulu Netflix Prime ect.) and the tea & coffee offered. Overall great stay, Iâ\\x80\\x99d also recommend The Wilky across the street for drinks (beer, cider) and late night sandwich. Peaches in Brooklyn is also really good for good soul food! The staff is friendly and the energy is great. Miriam and Vikas place was very nice.  There was a good selection of books in the room and the bed was very comfortable. Check in was a breeze and responses were immediate. Thank you for hosting me. As I told Vika many times before I left, their home was by far the best airbnb stay I've ever had in N.Y. The accommodations were so comfortable, spotlessly clean, true to the photos and even more wonderful  were the thoughtful hosts.  I only met Mariam for a few minutes, but if she lives with Vika and Josh, she must be just as sweet and attentive! \\n\\nAnd hey, they have a self cleaning toilet,  so there's that to look forward to as well! If you are a solo traveller in NY and looking for a nice place to stay, I would definitely recommend Mariam and Vika's place. They are the perfect hosts, with great and fast communication and are always keen to help out or give you tips. The room is just as in the pictures and has a great bed and it's own AC. On top of that the house and the bathroom have all the amenities you need. It's also close to the J-train, which gets you to Manhattan in about 25 min. Overall great stay!! This place exceeded my expectations. Vika always responded so quickly and she was so sweet and accommodating. The place was renovated and so hip. Super clean. They even had a flop-eared bunny and chocolates on the bed to greet me. I was looking forward to the bidet and I loved it! Very close to where I wanted to be and the J train. Definitely a great stay! I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have asked for or expected a better experience. Everything was clean and tidy and communication was open and pleasant. It's a nice, comfortable room that's located not far from the train which is very convenient. The hosts were very nice and are welcoming! The apartment is very clean and organized. Good if you're traveling by yourself and want a more economical place to stay at. Thank you!\"),\n",

The place is a little more tired than the photos suggest, but it is clean, roomy, and fairly comfortable. It was very easy to hear the neighbors in the mornings, and while it didn't bother us that much, it might affect those who like to sleep in.

In the kitchen, there is no coffee machine, but the small French press can be used for tea and coffee. Pots, plates, bowls and cutlery were very few.  Although the place could use a few chairs for dining, the flat was otherwise clean, comfortable and spacious. we had an amazing stay at Kalani's.

The room became hot and stuffy at night because you canâ\\x80\\x99t really sleep with the door open for proper air circulation. \\n\\nThe place was also much dirtier than we expected. The bathroom shower was dirty and there was urine on the rug, you can smell it. There were only men at the home as well, which is not a problem, but just something to consider. There was a lot of noise from Tenants upstairs as well. Overall, Jay is super polite and courteous.  The phrase \"you get what you paid for\" comes to mind.\\n\\nIf you\\'re considering staying at this place, here are some things to keep in mind:\\n- I would not necessarily describe Bushwick as a safe place. Check out the Wikipedia page and crime statistics for more details.\\n- The sofa looks pristine in the photo. It is much dirtier in reality.\\n- The kitchen is full of bugs. There is no bug screen on the window!! I got many, many mosquito bites while I stayed here! This was the worst part of my stay!\\n- The room is quite stuffy in the summer. There is no AC, and the pigeons right outside are too loud for the window to be opened.\\n\\nAll that said, Jay is a very communicative and friendly host. Muy cÃ³modo lugar, a dos cuadras de la estaciÃ³n del metro. \\nJay es muy agradable y contestÃ³ a la brevedad. We booked 9 days, and left after one night. The streets a sadly very unsafe in the evening and night. A few past reviews allready said so, and (Hidden by Airbnb) even tells you more about it.  We wete hoping in reallity it felt more safe.\\nThe room is extreemly hot and humid, and sadly the fan doesnt seem to do a lot. The bathroom was dirty. \\nThe host is very kind and stayed up late to welcome us (because we had a bad delay). They gave us a very small refund after canceling, but it was really dissappointing. (not even 20%) We canceled directly the next morning. But! It showed goodwill of the owner because the ad tells there will be no refund when you cancel. Great place! Came through for me and my boyfriend when we needed a place to stay fast!  I will start this review just as others have its not expensive but just because itâ\\x80\\x99s not expensive does not mean that some of the issues we had are OK.

BUT  I would never stay there again I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t recommend anyone staying there unless he seriously update his information and cleans.  When you walk in you see the orange couch from the photos only has more black than orange now it is so filthy the bedroom is much smaller than it appears to be in photos, and  and the bathroom is the size of a closet but Iâ\\x80\\x99m guessing thatâ\\x80\\x99s a New York thing I donâ\\x80\\x99t know.  We could have forgiven a dirty couch and a small room but the cleanliness is not something that we can skip on.  There were dirty dishes in the sink the kitchen trash was overflowing and the bathroom shower curtain was literally slimy with mold and  and the rug smelled of mildew because it was so soaked through with water. I really wish we could add the pictures I took of those things.  He did not disclose that he lived there which Iâ\\x80\\x99m really not tripping about because we didnâ\\x80\\x99t see him ,but he should I say was that he has someone staying on his couch because that was the common space.  For this place to be as small as it was for there to be so many people staying there you really cannot afford to not have this place extremely clean it was disgusting.   I read the reviews before booking this place and honestly they didnâ\\x80\\x99t go into much detail about how it actually was and I hope that my review save some people some money and time.  The place wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be so  bad  if the host would  take better care of it. A perfect place to stay in a great location, near the subway and a lot of groceries.\\nVery comfortable without spend much money!!! The bathroom is so gross. The sheets in the bedroom had a blood stain and the fan it was not working very well. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a good location, close to a subway station. Besides that I had no problem.

Quiet neighborhood with everything you need (including subway) just a few steps away. Paul was a fantastic host, always on top of everything and checking in constantly. Would recommend this place to anyone. Meine Freundin und ich waren fÃ¼r 8 NÃ¤chte im Appartement von Paul.\\nDie Lage ist sehr gut, eine Sub in der NÃ¤he fÃ¼hrt direkt nach Manhattan. Der Kontakt war gut, der Check in problemlos.\\nWir haben es genossen. Paul was very quick always when I needed to ask him anything.  The apartment was correct with a huge and a very comfortable bed. It is near to the subway ( 2 blocks away ) and the apartment was very clean The charm of this apartment discloses itself gradually during your stay. It's pretty basic, but everything you need is there and the location is superb. A bedroom with really comfortable bed is situated at the front side of the house. A narrow corridor alongside the recently renovated bathroom leads to the small sitting/dining room at the back of the house. Aside is the fully equipped kitchen. WiFi works perfect. A great asset of the place: the nights are quiet! Also the location is very practical: subway A and C (Utica station) is nearby, with direct connections to both JFK and Manhattan. The safe neighborhood has some great places: Sumner Cafe on Marcus Garvey Blvd for breakfast and Peaches on Lewis Av which serves really good food in lively ambiance. Paul is, although invisible, a perfect host who responds very quickly to questions.\"),\n",

Check in was with a lock box, so I liked that we could show up whenever we wanted and did not have to schedule a time to check in. The apartment had an unusual layout with the shower stall in the living space, but we loved the experience of staying in a pre-war, updated tenement building. The apartment was cute, tidy, and had everything we needed. I would definitely recommend Alyssa's place! Nice and comfortable stay in East Village.  Thank you! L'appartement d'Alyssa est dans un quartier agrÃ©able avec tout ce qu'il faut autour mÃ©tro, restaurants et commerces.

Encore merci.  Wow! This space was perfect for our needs. Great location, clean, quirky and fun touches of art on the walls, books, and a lovely view of the full moon over the backyard. So cozy we had to remind ourselves there was an amazing city to explore. Alyssa was really flexible about our very late check in. We arrived late at night, parking and getting keys was simple. The neighborhood was easy to navigate and had so much to offer. You wonâ\\x80\\x99t be disappointed here! Great location. Cozy bed. . Appartement avec un excellent emplacement. Alyssaâ\\x80\\x99s apartment is incredible! Great location and the bed and couch are very comfortable. Perfect weekend in the city. I hate leaving a negative review but I really want to be honest so other travelers don't experience what I did staying at Alyssa's apartment. Mostly during the evenings cigarette smoke enters the room from other apartments.  My eyes burned because of the smoke, I had sore throat, and my clothes and bath towel smelled of smoke.  There was only one night of the week that I stayed in the apartment that I didnâ\\x80\\x99t smell smoke.  All windows were closed and I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t find any vents.  If you are a smoker maybe this wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t bother you but its very difficult on a non-smoker.  When I sent a message to Alyssa she said that it usually dissipates when the air conditioner is on but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t find that to be helpful.  Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the reason for the 3 star rating.  The listing is not accurate. I think itâ\\x80\\x99s important to disclose this to guests on AirBnB before they book.  Other than that issue the bed was comfortable and the location was good, many restaurants in the area as well as Whole Foods in walking distance.\"),\n",

Other advantages: lots of parking lots around, a short walk to the Staten Island Ferry (10 minutes), 24 hours (free) Ferry service (great views on Liberty Island and Manhattan skyline), within 25 minutes in Downtown Manhattan and subway/bus stations.

They treated me not only as guest, but also like a friend. I feel comfortable for staying with them. I also like the decorations in their house with a sence of art. This makes their house distinctive. In short, I really enjoyed a very pleasure time here.  We stayed wit Ana & Dan for 5 nights in August and we couldn't have been made to feel more welcome. Their home is charming and inviting in every way. We were delayed 2.5 hours flying from Seattle into JFK. On arrival we were delayed on the tarmac another half hour waiting for an open gate. We'd arranged for a late check in - but when I realized we wouldn't make t to their home until after 1:30am I emailed from the plane. I was so relieved to receive a quick response saying to come anyway (despite our arrival in the wee hours of the morning) and they even asked if we'd like a snack. We refused the snack but Dan (knowing we'd be hungry because NOTHING was open in the terminal at that time of night) made us something anyway. We spent a few nice moments breaking bread in the middle of the night getting acquainted. There are many reviews that say how gracious Ana and Dan are - and how amazing the location is. They are all true. The Midtown location is perfect for getting anywhere in the city sightseeing that you'd like to go. It rained buckets two days while we were here but Ana was quick to notice the bad weather and offered us the use of umbrellas and ponchos so we could carry on with our plans. We're here to get my son off to camp in the Adirondacks in Upstate NY and Dan and Ana even helped me with getting a last minute load of clothes done so he'd have clean clothes to start his 3-weeks away from home. They were even gracious helping me to extend our stay when by accident we all realized that I had made a mistake and failed to book us through the final day before the bus leaves from Queens taking my son on his 4-hour ride to the Adirondacks. I had to work while here and Dan and Ana both helped me mix sightseeing with business. This is a wonderfully peaceful place with great proximity to Manhattan. You will be relieved and happy with your decision to stay here and you will remember Ana and Dan as friends you wish lived in your home town. - Thank you Ana and Dan for making our trip memorable and for helping when adjustments were necessary to our itinerary. We appreciate all you did to make us feel welcome! - Meredith & Tyger Great hosts, and a smart location where you get good value for money. It was a good sized room with plenty of wardrobe space. We had a comfortable stay  Ana and Dan are extremely helpful and warmhearted. The location is great.\"),\n",

Staying in the centre of the city let me explore the heart of the city by walk at all hours. i even managed to squeeze in a run till the United Nations building early one morning. There is a diner almost next door that serves very good breakfast. Wifi is blazing fast.  Great place for a cheap stay. Itâ\\x80\\x99s my third time back and itâ\\x80\\x99s always a good experience. Amazing location. Electronic doorlock, so you can check in at any time after they clean the room. Comfy bed, small room. Some amenities like iron, fridge available. The low walls can make sleeping hard if you don't use the provided earplugs. Place is totally fine, and reasonably clean. Youâ\\x80\\x99re getting what you pay for, cheep and good location.  Check in is done with codes/lock box, which is convenient. Great stay Excellent location, great price and easy to self-check in. Just great for one night Good value for NYC, but just be aware these are extremely basic accommodations, pretty much a hostel.  It's a cubicle with a small bed, walls open at top so you can hear other guests and see their lights, kind of hot...  If you're used to hostels and just need a place to sleep, you'll be fine.  Check in was very easy with codes and lock box. Host was good with communication during the day.\\n I would not recommend staying at this Airbnb. I ended up not staying here because of the cleanliness of the room. The Airbnb itself is actually a luggage storage business that you had to walk through to get to the room. The room itself is a closet at the business (which I think is illegal). Literally just a bed. No air conditioning and no lights in the room. Definitely spend the extra money on a hotel room.  The place is good for those who are looking to save money when staying in NY. It is pretty basic and the bed is somewhat hard to sleep. If you are a light sleeper the noises from other guests can be an issue. The walls are pretty thin and donâ\\x80\\x99t go up to the ceiling. The washroom can use some cleaning. Otherwise for a quick stay for the price and location canâ\\x80\\x99t ask for more.  The place is in a great location, on a walking distance to many interesting sites in Midtown, and close to the public transportation.\\nThe communication with the host was great. \\nThere are 4 rooms separated from a taxi/luggage office by a door. You have to go through the office to get to the washroom. \\nThis room is very small and fits better a small and slim person. \\nSince the walls donâ\\x80\\x99t connect to the ceiling, you can hear everything people on the other rooms are doing and they car hear everything you do. For this reason, you also canâ\\x80\\x99t make phone calls in the room neither turn on the lights after midnight. \\nI recommend this place to who is looking for a quick stay in a great location, but donâ\\x80\\x99t mind the lack of privacy and lack of space.  Great Host was very quick and responsive. Very friendly too. Definitely a nice spot for one person. Very secluded in its own spot. Nice location where you can walk to anything. Donâ\\x80\\x99t expect a lot of space though, itâ\\x80\\x99s very small but it works wonder if ya need a last minute space for another night in the city. Tight space but great to lay your head Comfortable bed at a location central to a lot of places in Manhattan. Small bedroom but the location is great, really clean and cheap. Get what you pay for super great location! Great centric location, just be aware that sound isolation between rooms is very low, and that those rooms are really small\"),\n",

So, good value of money if you planning a visit to New York to watch the US Open. Good response and host A large group of my friends rented Cathy's entire apartment.  She had us meet her brother upon check-in who could not speak English.  This made the hand-off of keys rather difficult.  He had recently smoked a cigarette in the apartment that he was suppose to be cleaning between stays.   In the morning we had to deal with a total communication break down and a violation of our privacy.  Cathy's brother had entered the apartment around 10am while most of us were still asleep.  He was apparently looking for a set of keys to pass on to the next guests who needed to drop off luggage; which should have been communicated to us.   While looking for the keys Cathy's brother entered a bedroom where one of the female guests was undressed.  I called Cathy to figure out why he was there.  He was claiming that there were three sets of keys and needed one of them specifically; we had only been given two sets of keys.  Finally we found another set of keys that had been left in the apartment but had not been given to us.   At this point Cathy's brother took two of the three sets of keys; making it more difficult for our large group to come and go during the remainder of our stay.  I had to call Cathy again to ask for her to brother to leave the apartment after the key issue had been resolved.  This was extremely frustrating.  Our privacy was violated and our one night of sleep was interrupted. Kathy was a great host and able to accommodate our travel schedule. We felt very welcomed.

       "  \"A wonderful place to stay after a busy day in town! Thank you Makoto for such a great time, I totally recommend! \\n The place was awesome and a good value for money. I highly recommend this place to future travelers.  Logement propre avec dÃ©co soignÃ©e. Le logement Ã\\xa0 un super rapport qualitÃ© prix, pas loin du mÃ©tro et des diffÃ©rents bus. A basic but convenient accommodation: a bed, small table and space in the closet. The AC was great.\\n\\nConor doesn't live there but his roommate and girlfriend. All of them are friendly and helpful.\\n\\nThe bed is comfortable, the pillows are just very thin/flat. Also no blinds in the windows so it gets quite bright early in the morning. \\n\\nThe shared bathroom was passable but definitely can be more clean and tidy.\\n\\nSince it is a small shared space right next to the room, you may expect some noise at night from the TV as they like lounging around in the living room. Unfortunately, my girlfriend was kept up until 3-4 am and after a long day she didn't get any rest.\\n\\nNevertheless, it is a good option for overnight or a weekend in NY. Conor is very nice and helpful, the room is nice, clean, and cozy. The only thing I would like to add is if the window has curtain, it will be perfect. Great stay, location was pretty close to the 135th train station, the apartment was clean too. I just wish there were blinds in the room. It was very bright in the morning. We had a pretty good week at Connor's place. I stayed there with my girlfriend. At the beginning we were a bit worried about security issues in the area but that quickly proved itself to be no problem at all in that area. It is overall very safe there, there is police literally in every corner and people are super friendly in Harlem. We really loved that. It is also not very far away from the metro (135th street) (10mn walk). The only thing is that sidewalks get really dirty when trash gets dumped there for its pick up (rats included) but that is probably a NYC thing. The flat  also looks recently renewed and the room had an AC which turned out to be very helpful during the first (unusually) hot days of our stay. The room has also a wardrobe which was also helpful to store comfortably our clothes. Connor doesn't seem to live at the flat so we shared the flat with Makoto and his girlfriend. At the beginning it felt a bit strange, but after knowing each other a little better it was perfect. Makoto gave us valuable tips for the city that turned out being quite helpful and enjoyable. Oh by the way, there are blinds now in the room so that helped a lot in the room. When windows are closed the noise is reduced to a minimum, you can still hear some of it but it was ok for us to sleep. Connor even provided us with ear plugs and blindfolds to help us sleep although we didn't need to use them. Good for the sensitive people though. Connor was also very welcoming to us. We got stuck at the airport and took us longer than expected to get there and he waited for us to greet us personally. I would definitely recommend this stay for people looking for an affordable place in NY ho don't mind sharing the flat with other people. Harlem has a lot to offer too and that was in our case a big plus because everything was close by. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a very nice apartment in upper Manhattan in Harlem neighborhood. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a modern bedroom and their guests are so kind! It was our first experience in Airbnb and for sure we will come back again to Conorâ\\x80\\x99s and Makoto bedroom!!!! We are so exigent and we recommend 100% this bedroom! Connor and Mokoto were both amazing hosts and made me feel right at home. The light is amazing in you place, but also, so glad you had blinds lol! Just a really great stay overall!\"),\n",

The subway is a 3-minute walk and plenty of food and little street stalls await you in the neighborhood. \\nI would highly recommend booking with Debbie and Hilel if a trip to NYC are in your future plans.  Great place for a lot of people, enough room for everyone, very stylish, & cute place!  Fantastic large flat. Minutes from the metro line straight into brooklyn and manhattan.  Really well appointed. Would recommend to anyone wanting to have a nice base for exploring New York.    Excellent location near train and bus stops. Very spacious as it was plenty of room for my party of 6. Unfortunately there is only 1 full bathroom, and a half bathroom with no mirror, so we found ourselves pressed for time when getting ready to go out. There were not any washcloths provided, be sure to bring your own if you use those. Overall great place to stay! The hosts respond quickly and can assist you with any needs. The apartment is spacious, clean and quiet on the inside. It is located at very busy intersection. Once inside you hardly hear what is happening on the outside, so it is really tranquil once you are inside. \\n\\nThe subway station distance is convenient in very short walking distance . The neighborhood is multicultural. \\n\\nThe self check-in is convenient, as there are no keys involve. Was visiting NYC for the US Open with 6 friends. Fit 7 of us comfortably. Beds were nice. The place was clean. Was close to the subway. Overall a very good experience and value. This is by far the best Airbnb Iâ\\x80\\x99ve stayed in.

Central park is at your doorstep and spending time in the park made me feel that I was truly part of the city whether I was bicycling in the park, walking there  in the morning or attending one of the many free concerts.  Thank you for a marvelous few days! Terrific location close to the park, subway and Lincoln Center.  You will not be disappointed! Canâ\\x80\\x99t beat the location!

Not much to do in the neighborhood but the C line is a few blocks away that goes straight into Manhattan. Thanks Giovanni! An amazing home with a ton of stuff to do nearby. The host is very accommodating and gives great recommendations for food and other local activities. My family and I went to Brooklyn for a long weekend trip, we chose to stay in Bed Stuy due to the proximity to the local artist we were working with. We did not know a whole lot about the neighborhood and glad we stumbled upon a less touristy, beautiful and full of character part of Brooklyn. \\n\\nWe traveled with a 14-month toddler and that means logistics. Giovanni went above and beyond helping me to arrange a comfortable space for the little one, I shipped the pack-and-play and baby food, Giovanni set-it up for us to ensure it was ready upon arrival. He also made sure we had tons of cozy blankets, there was no shortage of them. :)\\n\\nSpace itself is very accommodating for a group or a family of 4-5 people. New York spaces can be quiet tight, contrary to that, Giovanni's ground-level space in a brownstone building is quite spacious, has a marble counter kitchen with basic kitchen tools you may need during your stay.\\n\\nAlthough it rained most days when we were in Brooklyn, we managed to step out and explore the neighborhood and found a couple of awesome dining spots, including LunAtico and Saraghina.\\n\\nGreat place if you wish to branch out and explore the real Brooklyn! Giovanni is a great guy, really accommodating and let me check in early. The space is great and easy to get around from. Well worth a stay. If you are going to NY, stay with Giovanni! He gave great local tips and his place is both beautiful and reasonably priced. It is about a 5 minute walk to the C train entrances, uptown C train will take you up through Times Square and Downtown can take you right over to Brooklyn Park. We only spent about $15 total on the metro pass for 3 days, no need to Uber! Giovanni recommended Ragazzis to eat which is literally next door and amazing, along with Brooklyn Park which ended up being the highlight of the trip. Would absolutely stay with him again. This is probably one of the best AirBnB I have stayed at! It had everything you can think of: comfy bed, tv, WiFi, full kitchen, washer & dryer, shampoo, condition, etc.! The location was nice & a short walk away from the subway. There were great little spots to eat just a few blocks away which was great because we decided to stay mainly in Brooklyn instead of Manhattan.

There were a lot of options of things to do around us. Unfortunately the cons outweighed the pros. Bathroom was really mouldy and smelled terrible. The bed was very uncomfortable and sank into the middle, and the mattress was really stained. The bedroom door didn't fully close because the damp in the apartment had swollen the wood of the door. The whole apartment smelled really musty. The bathroom was the worst area. We had to request another bathmat as it was part of what was making the bathroom smell bad, and the host kindly replaced it. The shower very suddenly goes scalding hot, even when no other taps in the apartment are being used. The pros were that the host was responsive and apologetic to the bathmat request and the location was good, but the place really needed a deep clean before we got there. There was a thick buildup of mould in the shower grout, and especially for the price, this is really not good enough Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid.

The bedroom opens up to a quaint patio with seating which we didn't have enough time to enjoy. We also should have definitely gone up to the rooftop but were preoccupied with wedding festivities.\\n\\nOur only qualms with Igor's place was not being able to stay longer!\\n\\nPS\\nOne suggestion might be to have some utensils set aside for guests; we were thirsty one morning and grabbed a couple of glasses for tap water from the cupboard but felt guilt about possibly intruding in your housmate's belongings. We also wanted to clean up after ourselves but weren't sure where to wash/place the glasses afterwards. Igorâ\\x80\\x99s place is absolutely great. We loved the location in the very authentic area. The room is comfortable and is suited with all you need. The bed is big + and yet we enjoyed one evening Netflix with our own login. We did not meet Igor but instead we had the pleasure of meeting his roommate Nick who is a great guy. We had a lot of privacy, and was really enjoying the place.  Friendly host, conveniently located, very clean and ample street parking. The host is very accommodating, and you will enjoy the comfort and cleanliness of this apartment.  This is the first time I have arrived at a BNB, and found it more appealing than the posted pictures. You will not be disappointed in, this affordable modern find. Igor was a fantastic host and live up to his high rating on ABNB! During our very short stay, we were able to use all the amenities! Even enjoyed the delightful little balcony. 100% would stay here again and recommend it as well.  I loved everything about this Airbnb!! Our host, Igor, was outstanding. He is super nice and welcoming. When we arrived he offered us a drink then showed us to our room. Everything was super clean and neat! He had a good amount of toiletries displayed (if needed) in the bathroom and the overall presence was very clean. The room was beautiful yet simple. The balcony was a great size not to mention the rooftop! The location isnt exactly close to all the touristy attractions but it is in a safe neighborhood. If we had the option to stay there again we would definitely do it. I totally recommend this Airbnb! \"),\n",

Restaurants and the subway station (metro line M leads to Downtown Manhattan, on weekends the M line just operates to Essex Street) are close to the apartment, itâ\\x80\\x98s approximately a 10 minute walk! Dorina is a very friendly host, we can recommend her apartment!  You can look forward to a 5 star experience staying at Dorina's. She has everything perfectly organized. There are many extras, e.g. fluffy bathrobes, eye masks for sleeping, . tv's in the bedrooms, many thoughtful touches.Kitchen stocked with an assortment of breakfast items, e.g. eggs, bread, fruit, coffee, etc. Everything was in good working order.  There were menus for local restaurants and tourist info, and the local taxi is prompt and reasonably priced. Dorina could not have been more helpful and is very friendly. She's next door or else just a text away.  Her place is conveniently located between JFK and La Guardia. This was perfect for us since we arrived in one airport and left out of the other. It's an easy walk to the subway to get to the city. The neighborhood is safe and quiet.  After the hustle and bustle in the city we appreciated coming back to the tranquility.

The subway and bus stops are very close and within easy walking distance.  Dorian provided some breakfast basics, which we greatly appreciated!

Air conditioning in the room was awesome.  Animals in the apartment kept to themselves for the most part. I donâ\\x80\\x99t like animals so I noticed a smell but most normal people would probably be okay. Un excelente lugar ubicado en un gran barrio con todo lo que uno necesita accesible y lo mejor de todo, bien tranquilo.  Tiene, a 10 minutos caminando, una estaciÃ³n de tren que da acceso a practicamente todos los lugares en la zona de NYC.  Marisol, su madre Lucy, Ramona y sus mascotas son excelentes anfitriones, haciendonos sentir como en casa.  El hogar de Marisol es super acogedor, organizado, limpio y tiene todo lo necesario para pasar unos dÃ\\xadas inolvidables.

Even though the languages are different, she always tried her best to help us! She also got the cutest pets in the world!! Omg, her dog, cats and birds!! Super cute and quiet!! My dad and little sis really enjoyed their stay there! They are so thoughtful! They even put many iced drinks in the room, e.g. various soda, and also beers!! I will recommend her room to others!  Marisol is amazing and really nice, as much as her mother.\\nI did the reservation for my sister and her boyfriend, and They were really comfortable there. If you love pets Bruno  is so friendly and a cutest host  Excellent place and host very nice,i will HIGHLY  RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. The space was very clean and nice. it was easy to get public transportation and it\\'s great if you have to catch a flight from LA Guardia. There was only one tiny glitch in tried asking someone at the house for directions but they only spoke Spanish and little English. It gave me a chance to use the little Spanish I knew. overall great space for a great price. Marisolâ\\x80\\x99s place was very nice and in a quiet neighborhood. It was perfect for us as we were very close to the place that we came to visit. It was close to the subway.

This room has a private bathroom and balcony, with a beautiful view. (The balcony, that is.) Shad was clear and easy to communicate with. Really enjoyed our stay! The place was spacious and clean. We were able to check in at 3pm. Found parking across the st. The place is very simple on the inside (just a bed, table, and a chair.) Bathroom was large and clean. We had access to two balconies, one private and one shared. My partner and I walked to the subway on Utica and Ralph ave. We were uncomfortable walking to the Ralph ave subway lots of sketchy things happening in daylight and  (specially at night). Some parts of this neighborhood were definitely rough, so we decided to drive for the rest of our stay. Overall I think it is a good deal if you are looking for a place with a private bathroom.

However, If you are looking for convenience and safety I donâ\\x80\\x99t recommend it. \\nThe location is different as described. We visited from another country and felt really insecure in the neighborhood and it took us more than an hour to get anywhere. Good and cheap place to stay in Brooklyn, area looks run down and unsafe,  so donâ\\x80\\x99t recommend the local subway stops especially at night. \\n\\nI took an Uber to Atlantic Station and then got on the subway into manhattan\\n\\nThe WiFi can be temperamental, so if you are travelling from aboard make sure you have internet on your phone as a back up.\\n\\nQuick responses from the hosts. Enjoyed New York! Had a great stay here! We were able to find parking a couple streets away which was convenient. The room is simple with just a bed, desk, and chair, but we really were only there to sleep so it was perfect for what we needed. The rooftop area was great and a nice touch. I also liked having a lock and key for our room as a bit of added privacy. It's just a quick walk to the subway station, and one stop away there are tons of bars and restaurants to explore. Would definitely stay here again next time I'm in New York! The private balcony being away from it all was perfect. I definitely enjoyed myself. The views were calming I would definitely return.

Unica nota negativa: invasione di zanzare e mosconi che hanno scoraggiato l'utilizzo del giardino interno, molto carino. \\nHo avuto modo di conoscere Elise velocemente perchÃ¨ al mio arrivo era in partenza per le vacanze, tuttavia Ã¨ stata gentile e molto disponibile per check in e check out.

The place is a basement apartment which is very practical, close to the subway, a supermarket and restaurants, 15 min away from Manhattan. It's not perfect but it has everything you need, mainly a very comfortable bed and a bathroom. We spent most of our time out anyway since it's New York and there are so many things to do and see.

Takes about half an hour to get to Times Square and itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to reach the Brooklyn Bridge by foot. The apartment is okay, good value for money. Great if you just want a comfy bed and hot shower at the end of a day of exploring the city, maybe not the best option if you want to spend a lot of time in your apartment. Elise's apartment is amazing. The zone is great too, very safe, with lots of restaurants, bars, and stores nearby, yet the street itself is very quiet. We arrived very late at night and she had everything ready for us and left the keys in a lockbox, we went right in, no issues. The apartment has its own entrance, very decent kitchen, bathroom is good size too and the queen bed is super confortable, right what we needed after walking all day in NYC. There is also a futon which we did not use but it is a good option for larger groups (we were only 2). There is no TV which would have been nice but we did not really need it as wifi is very good.

There is also another line (which I didn\\'t use) going to Grand Central. The neigbourhood has an ethnic feel to it and seems very safe. I was going back quite late and both the subway and the hood were just fine. And finely as far as the train noise goes, it is loud but I used earplugs and noise cancelling headphones (I always use them on planes) and I slept just fine. Which surprised me, as I\\'m a very light sleeper. Oh, I forgot to mention that Shera offers amazing value at a very affordable price, so don\\'t be rude staying with her and then giving her \"not so good\" ratings. She points out all the pros and cons in the description. I personally like it very much. And would stay again!'),\n",

       "  'Absolutely loved this minimalist apartment. Staying here truly made me feel like a local. Check in is so easy and itâ\\x80\\x99s right around the corner from some amazing hyper local spots. What you need and nothing more. Was a good stay for a quick stop in New York, could be cleaner but in the best area! Thomasâ\\x80\\x99 apartment was incredibly well located in the West Village! He was able to accomodate us in super short notice and was always eager to help us with whatever problem we encountered! The air conditioning really worked, which was vital for our stay in NYC during the summer. The only thing to watch out for is that there are no elevators, so if you have large suitcases, coming up the stairs might be an issue Dreamy white studio in the cutest village of New York. It is quite small but equally lovely. Please do not stay here. When I came to the apartment it had blood on multiple areas of the sheets, there were rips in the sheets and the mattress was filthy with debris and hair and stains. That is something I take very seriously. It is a health risk and it\\'s unsanitary and completely unacceptable. No one should be expected to sleep on a bed in those conditions. The first thing I think of when I see multiple little blood stains the size of pin heads with smears in different areas of the sheets is Bed Bugs. I would not risk staying there if that\\'s the case. I went to AirBnB\\'s website and it said if you have issues with an apartment, contact the host first to rectify. I did that. I told Thomas the sheets were bloody, dirty and ripped and I was worried it was bed bugs. He was quick to let me out of staying there. Thomas was super understanding and helpful and offered to refund me 100% and told me he would call AirBnb with the intention of canceling my reservation. I told him I would not be staying there and checking into a hotel. Before I did that I said, I want to confirm again that you will refund me and cancel. He said, \"As I said, I will refund you fully.\" So I moved on based on what the host told me. He called AirBnb to cancel and whatever they said to him changed his decision and he wrote me back and tried to bargain with me. He tried to backtrack and say it\\'s not fair for him to give me my money back. He went back on his word, and it was all in writing. All I asked is that he give me the refund he agreed to. That\\'s all I kept asking for. Then he became hostile, rude and judgemental. Saying things like, \"You\\'re high maintenance\" and \"You shouldn\\'t stay at AirBnbs\". He then went on to say that he doesn\\'t care about one bad review because he\\'s moving from that apartment anyway so he doesn\\'t care. That right there shows a lack of care or concern on behalf of the host. I have all of that in writing. When a host rents their dwelling through AirBnb, they represent AirBnb. Yet, when I tried to contact AirBnb after he went back on his word they took 48 hours to get back in touch with me said it\\'s out of their hands. Thomas took my money yet I didn\\'t stay there. Whether it\\'s bed bugs or not, no one seems to have an explanation for what causes the blood on sheets. I would not have slept on a bed in that condition and after finding the bed that dirty, I did not feel safe in that environment. I made that clear to Thomas and Airbnb that I would not stay there. Then they kept offering to clean the sheets. Do NOT stay here. Super clean and comfortable! Perfect location â\\x80\\x94 everything was walkable. Checking in and out was a breeze! The location of this place is amazing. Close to subway for easy access to anywhere in the city. Great restaurants right around the corner, coffee shops, grocery, and close to Washington square park. The place is very quiet, surprising for the area, and Thomas is very responsive. Will book this place again for future NYC trips. Thomasâ\\x80\\x99s place is smart clean and stylish. The location is excellent ; so much to see and do at the doorstep! Thomasâ\\x80\\x99s place was perfect for what I needed. Quiet building and area, tucked in a cute neighborhood, just steps from everything I could need in the city. There are a plethora of boutiques, specialty spots and neighborhood hangouts all around as well as staples like CVS and delis. My favorite would be Bleeker Street pizza, just a couple blocks away, excellent for a late night bite! Thomas was super responsive and even gave me tips on free museum admission and the local eats that I was interested in.'),\n",

Pros: \\nGood location,  beds were adequate and good to have a washing machine:\\n\\nCons: \\nCooker did not work and we asked this before coming and it was confirmed it was. Instead, we had a two ring element which had to be placed on the stove as there was no other space to place it. One element hardly worked. When we complained you bought another two element electric heater which is not the answer. The small black and decker oven is tiny and burned the food we put in it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s like hiring a car that does not work and being given a horse as a replacement. Just not good enough. Poor lighting, most not working. Bathroom shower doors do not close and shower temperature imposible to control with chances of being scalded. No natural light. Bedrooms minuscule and no privacy as all are open at the ceiling, this was not made clear at all in your advert. Television impossible to watch due to very poor reception. Staircase coming up to flat strongly smelling of urine. This was our first big family holiday abroad, something that we had been saving for and looking forward to. We loved NY, especially the people. We expected to get a fair deal for what we payed for and this simply did not happen. The description of the apartment was not real, and now we understand why you cannot see the reviews before booking. We hope you can be more fair to other clients in the future. The only disappoint we had in NY was with the apparent. Shame!\\n The location was great with lots of local amenities, coffee shops and restaurants. It was also great walking distance to lots of different things. The beds were extremely comfortable and the apartment was great. There werenâ\\x80\\x99t any wash clothes and we messaged to ask if they had some. We were told they would bring some, but never did and we ended up just buying some. there was a load of dirty/wet towels in the washer/dryer combo so they could have been in there. We werenâ\\x80\\x99t sure if they were dirty so we didnâ\\x80\\x99t look. \\n Other than the towel issue there was no real complaints Great place! Clean, quick responses, and even better location.

I'll definately choose this place again.. Appartement tres bien situe. A 5/10 mns du metro qui amene en 30 mns a Manathan. L appartement est tres propre et bien equipe. Steeve et virginia sont tres acceuillants! Nous y retournerons pour un prochain voyage a new york.  The apartment is very nice and immaculately clean.  Close to public transportation and street parking is easy to find within vicinity. Stores and restaurants close by and near attractions like Prospect Park, Luna Park, NY Aquarium within 20-25min drive. \\nVery clean and peaceful neighborhood. \\nHighly Recommend to consider a pleasant stay.  Virginia and Steve were very friendly, and always responded quickly. Their apartment was clean, comfortable and in a quiet and safe neighborhood. I would recommend!  None Our first AirBnB experience was great. Steve was a great host, Virginia was out of town. Steve was very friendly. Having an apartment to stay in was definitely a great first experience, will we definitely be visiting the city more and hope their place is available. Virginia and Steveâ\\x80\\x99s place is lovely, accessible and clean! The ceilings are vaulted and the front bedroom ceiling isnâ\\x80\\x99t closed, but it worked OK for us because noone stayed up late being noisy. I'm sorry this review comes so late, but when we left Virginia and Steve's we still had over a week's worth of travels ahead of us.\\nHowever: the apartment is great, quite comfy for four people and still feasible for 6; and V&S are lovely hosts, very generous, thoughtful, accessible and discreet. We stayed at their Brooklyn airbnb for a week and it was a truly lucky choice. A no-key, code system for the doors makes checking in and out, as well as coming and going, easy as pie; the bedrooms were clean and cool (AC and ceiling fans to accommodate all cool-air tastes); both kitchen and bathroom were also very clean and well-stocked too, which is great if you're checking in late at night and don't have time to shop for milk and coffee; and, last but not least, the little terrace at the back is a delightful resting spot.\\nAs for position, the Avenue M stop on the Q subway line into Manhattan (or Coney Island!) is a mere minutes' walk away; the street is very quiet both during the day and at night, but just a few steps will take you to larger streets and avenues with no shortage of shops, chain stores, delis&supermarkets, ATM's, dine-in or take-out restaurants and other kinds of services (I especially recommend Lucky May's Laundromat on Ocean and M and their drop-off service for those who don't like schlepping dirty clothes around in their suitcases: leave everything with them in the morning and pick it up squeaky clean and folded at night). Thanks V&S for having us, and I wish you all the best. Steve and Virginia were warm and welcoming. The space is exactly as advertised, meticulously clean, comfortable, and with nice touches such as  food in the fridge, a coffee pot and coffee. Itâ\\x80\\x99s also quiet, away from street noise. I will definitely stay there again. Comfortable and stylish suite in a quiet and friendly neighborhood. Virginia & Steve were hospitable and quick to respond to all our needs.

The rooms themselves are not air conditioned, so they were hot, but the kitchen and living space were air conditioned. Overall we had a good stay!  The room weâ\\x80\\x99ve stayed in, is not designed for 2 people as it has many things for such a small space - On the amenities, it says it has A/C, however there was only 1 and it was located in the kitchen. There were fans in the rooms, but during our stay the fan broke down too, which caused a lot of frustration... \\n\\nTo match peopleâ\\x80\\x99s convenience, A/C should be installed in all rooms so that it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t make them suffocate in the heat inside the room - aside from that, location was great as it was close to two subway stations and it got us to Manhattan within 25-35min.

He didn't overstate the studio apt in the description and he delivered what he promised. This is an older building, with an old staircase which leads to the 4th floor studio. It was clean and quiet. The old style bathroom with its pink tile and tub shower was great. The water pressure and temperature was brilliant. Its so old style that it has 4 knobs on the tub- one set for the tub water and the other set for the shower- I have never seen that before. The studio kitchen has a full size refrigerator and there is also a gas stove that we did not use....the microwave didn't work- but I forgot to tell Frank about it until this review. The Murphy bed was comfortable and my son slept on the pull out IKEA type love seat sofa- no complaints. The air conditioner worked perfectly- so glad we got there after the heat wave from the previous week.  Frank answered all of my texts almost immediately.  Again, this is a no frills stay, and if you understand that, you will really enjoy this slice of NYC life.  Driving tip: If you are using local parking, drop your people and stuff in front of the Greek Orthodox church across the street from the apt. They keep the street in front of the church reserved with a few traffic cones which makes it great for temporary parking. Use Spot Hero to find a local parking lot-parking in NYC is expensive, no advice there.  Lugar muy bien ubicado, a un par de calles del metro. Limpio, aunque el edificio en general tiene un poco de mal olor al ser un edificio antiguo. Es perfecto para 2 personas, mÃ¡ximo 3, la relaciÃ³n precio-calidad es muy buena. Altamente recomendable para pasar algunos dÃ\\xadas en Nueva York. Francesco was great! Super fast at responding to messages and super helpful regarding my trip. I would rent from him again in a heartbeat!  The appartment is nice, ideally situated, near de red line for the subway. The neiborhood is quiet and really secure. The principal room is large and stylish, the kitchen is a real room where you can eat. Everything was at our disposal: towels, shampoo, body wash, conditionner. Some minor improvements could be made. I definitly recommand. Tutto molto bello e curato, non manca nulla! Prezzo ottimo Francesco is a terrific host. He's really friendly and communicative, his place is clean and it's a great value for people who'd like to stay in a central location a few blocks from the subway. I highly recommend! Nice apartment in an old and very typical building. Close to Central Park and metro stops. Francesco responded quickly and with accuracy. This apartment is in a great location! As advertised you are 4 floors up with stair access only. It's not an issue but something to be aware of if you're bringing heavy/multiple luggage. Francesco is super helpful and very quick with his responses. We had some issues locating the lockbox and connecting to the wifi initially but one quick phone call and we were good to go. The bed was a little small for two people to sleep on but there is an air mattress if you'd prefer. The kitchen was more than enough space to cook and eat (although we didn't use it) and the main room was a good size. My only real complaint was that there was no body wash or toilet paper when we arrived. It wasn't that much of an issue since we had brought our own soap and grabbed a 97 cent roll of toilet paper from the store around the corner. This place is good for a weekend stay in NYC.

To say that the apartment is conveniently located is an understatement.  The location is GREAT!  So close to a subway hub, great shopping, and a wonderful array of restaurants.  (If you're looking for excellent NY style pizza you've got to try Gino's on Atlantic Ave!)  \\n\\nThe apartment itself is clean and comfortable.  The beds are super comfy, the kitchen is well stocked, and the living room gave us a great space for a couple of fun game nights with our family and friends.  We traveled during the heat of the summer and the AC was fantastic.  It kept the entire apartment really cool.  We actually had to turn it down at one point because it was doing such a great job of cooling the space.  After a long day in the hot city, it was so nice to come back to our comfortable home base.\\n\\nKay gave us complete privacy, but also was available, and quickly answered any questions we had.\\n\\nWe had a fantastic stay!  Great space for a great price!  We would love to come back again sometime. Thanks Kay! La ubicaciÃ³n es excelente en Brooklyn, al lado de 8 lÃ\\xadneas de metro distintas. El barrio no es especialmente bonito pero la casa estÃ¡ en una calle tranquila lejos del ruido del trÃ¡fico. Hay supermercados y un centro comercial muy cerca.\\nEl espacio es diÃ¡fano, con salÃ³n, cocina y baÃ±o abajo  y las habitaciones (sin baÃ±o) arriba., tipo loft. Las escaleras son desaconsejables para niÃ±os pequeÃ±os. La estructura es un poco antigua y algÃºn suelo estÃ¡ inclinado, pero estÃ¡ limpio y bien acondicionado. La sensaciÃ³n es muy espaciosa para lo que suele ser NY, se estÃ¡ realmente muy cÃ³modo. From the moment my 2 friends and I arrived, we had a great experience--perfect location with an entrance to Atlantic terminal station just around the corner. Kay was available and responded quickly when we had delays-- Kay's aunt was able to meet us and show us around the apartment even after delays pushed back our arrival time! The space itself was larger than I expected and both the upstairs open loft bedroom and area were spacious. Even when we decided to cook, there was oil, salt and pepper already stocked in the kitchen. Though not a problem for us, the apartment is accessed via a half flight of stairs, so be mindful of your packing! Otherwise, we had everything we needed and more...lovely experience!  Kay's place was perfect! The house is extremely comfortable and we felt right at home during our trip to Brooklyn. The location is great, with easy access to major subway station to get anywhere in the city and within walking distance of grocery stores and restaurants. I'd absolutely stay here again and I highly recommend! Kay was an amazing host. She accommodated my flight arrival and departure times. Actively gave great food and nightlife recommendations within the area. Was willing to help with any and everything we needed. The place was great. Clean, spacious, and close to food, bars, and the train. I would definitely come back for another stay. This place is awesome! The location is phenomenal, the convenience to anything that you could ever want is great, and the apartment is super cute! Kay is a great host and I cannot wait to book my next trip to the city. We loved our stay at Kay's apartment in Brooklyn.  The neighborhood is in a great location and the subway less than a block away.  The apartment space is large and is fitted with all comfort needs.  It is an old brownstone building, over 100 year sold, and we loved the character of the place and the street.  Lots of stairs, the apartment is on two levels but this places  you well above the street.  Kay helped us out with our airport taxi and put us on to a local dive bar which we really enjoyed.  We would definitely stay here again when in Brooklyn. The Kay's apartment is in great location. Subway is just around the corner with good access to Manhattan. The apartament was very spacious and clean. I felt like at home. Bed was comfortable. The kitchen was well-equipped (coffemaker, microwave, good selection of coffees, teas and some sweets). There is a lot of shops and restaurants nearby (e.g. Whole Foods Market, Target, Shake Shack).  Kay answered quickly all questions we had. I definitly recommend this place.\"),\n",

Matt's place is super convenient to get to and a great place to be in Brooklyn. I easily got there and back to Grand Central on the Green Line, which was easy.

Big beautiful window in the room made it feel like some kind of loft space. The bed and pillows were hotel-level comfortable, and the couch was nice too.

The space was very clean and comfortable. There were also drinks and snacks provided. \\n\\nThe only reason for not giving 5 stars all around is the air conditioning in the downstairs apartment. The bedroom does not have a ceiling fan or any power outlets to plug a fan into at all. The only air conditioning unit for the apartment is about 15 feet away from the bedroom and left me uncomfortably hot during the night as the outside temperature was in the high 90s throughout the daytime. \\n\\nAside from the air conditioning I would highly recommend staying here. George was a great host and has a very nice place in a fantastic location in Harlem. I am not sure what I can say about George's place that other reviewers have not said before. This is a wonderful place to stay if you are visiting New York City or have business at Columbia University.  George was there to greet me and show me around his place and get oriented to the area. His place is nice and cozy with a great couch that is perfect for napping on after a day of flying.  There are many places to eat near by and the subway is a fairly short walk away.  This is definitely my go to place to stay in the city. Georgeâ\\x80\\x99s place was amazing; great location, huge space that is hard to come by in NYC, privacy and very clean.

The apartment is clean! George is a excellent host! He met us in person even after our flight made us hours late for arrival. He suggested places that we should check out that would interest us. He provided us with everything we needed including fresh fruit.

Very nice spot in the heart of Manhattan. Close to the subways, Times Square, Penn station, etc. Perfect for single travellers I got what I\\'ve paid for if you\\'re staying for a couple of nights or even 3 nights. Just a piece of advice don\\'t bring big bag or luggage because the room is small one, other than that place have very good location! Good value, great location  Very good value for staying overnight in NYC.  The rooms are pretty small and its basically a big room with room dividers setup.  Each divider has a door and your space is not much wider than your bed.  There are NO CEILINGS for any of the spaces.  Its a great deal for the price, but you cant do more than go back and go to sleep.   Everything was okay  I\\'ve stayed at another place like this, but it was a bit more well done.  As the listing states, this is more of a hostel environment.  The only issues I had is it wasn\\'t done as well as the other.  I had a scare at the beginning as I was told I wouldn\\'t be able to drop my luggage early as they had stated, but that ended up working out ok.  I didn\\'t mind that the place had an open ceiling or that other people would be around, but there\\'s a list of \"rules/suggestions\" that other people didn\\'t tend to abide by.  The last place I stayed at like this had someone at the desk 24/7, which is kinda what I expected with this kind of setup. Maybe I shouldn\\'t have expected it, but because I did that\\'s why I was more let down.  People had their lights on late, which I could see from my open ceiling room.  I could hear entire phone conversations twice by two different individuals (and they weren\\'t in \"hushed\" tones)....and someone had knocked on the door for 15 minutes one morning because they didn\\'t have the code to the door, so needless to say I didn\\'t sleep well when going to bed, or enjoy being woken up each day to various issues.  If someone had been at the desk those things might not be as much of an issue.\\n\\nOverall, a decent place to lay your head if everyone abides by the guidelines....but if they don\\'t it could make your evening or morning miserable. It\\'s hard to complain about any stay in a clean space in NYC for less than $60/night... so I won\\'t.  Honestly, it\\'s an old space and impossible to clean perfectly.   [Those who have lived in New York know what I mean here. ]  Fila does a pretty darn good job, considering.  The space isn\\'t aesthetically pleasing... but whatever.  Again, it\\'s a good value.  My only real issue was the half wall.  I can\\'t understand not building walls that go to the ceiling.  But... again... this place offers great value.  It\\'s better than staying in a hostel room with a bunch of other people, and frankly it\\'s less expensive than other cabin-style locatiobns.  But don\\'t mistake it for a hotel, either.  Fila\\'s ad should make that clear. Perfect place close to Empire State Building accurate description  and good location. good for a nights stay\\n\\n Very basic, but good value Really good location. Clean room. Good for a short stay in NYC. Everything was very clean and  friendly. Great location in NYC Good value, great location. It is located in very convenience place. This room is the same as pictures. It means small but good enough for me.  Great location with access to all areas in the city.   I did not like the place. it is something like a luggage storage and a laundry, with a lot of washing machines running. One day i was taking a shower and a washing machine throwed water and soap in my legs, because everithing is in same place. There were pubes in the shower and in soaps. In three days, they did not take out the soaps with the pubes away. In beedroon walls not reach the cealing, so u can hear everything and can see lights of other room. they have lots of rules for such a bad place. would never get back here or recommend the place. The location is great. The room is simple but just what I needed El lugar es tal y como se describe, efectivamente es muy muy pequeÃ±o, pero tiene una ubicaciÃ³n inmejorable! cerca de absolutamente todo! si solo buscÃ¡s un lugar donde descansar esta es tu opciÃ³n! Great choice for those looking for a great location at a very cheap price. Literally just a bed - sharing with other people with 7ft walls ( as listed). Personally felt uncomfortable here and wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t advise unless really on a tight budget You get what you pay. They never told me the rooms don\\'t have roofs so everyone can hear your noises and you can hear those of them. Bathroom need a nice cleaning. Everything else is ok. Great location & price; worth the value.\\nWould stay again!'),\n",

It had a little balcony off of it too that was surrounded by trees so it was very private! The room was clean and well stocked for our needs.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s a five minute walk to the ferry, and you can get off at Roosevelt Island and take the tramway across to Midtown very easily, or ride it all the way down to the financial district. Some subway stations nearby are currently closed, so definitely utilize the ferry! Lots of good food around the area too! \\n\\nFor me personally, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll probably choose only to stay in a place with a private bathroom in the future just to make getting out in the mornings easier, but otherwise would definitely stay here again!

Reservation with Bloz was done almost immediately like all answers to my messages. Late arrival wasn't problem. So thanks Bloz for wonderful vocation in NYC. We stayed in room 3.

Good location (although good to note is that the closest subway station, Broadway - a 15 min walk- is closed until Feb. for renovations, the city provides a free shuttle to the next closest station). \\n\\nThe place is spacious for this price in NYC, and very clean (except for the tub/shower which needed a deep cleaning, the rest of the apartment and bathroom is very clean). The balcony is a great added plus. Check in was seamless and directions were clear.

Good central location on the Lower East Side, though occasionally the loud music from the neighboring bar required use of the thoughtfully-supplied white noise machine.  Christopher was a super-attentive, friendly and helpful host even via long distance.   Christopher was a great host and I enjoyed staying in his stylish (and clean) apartment â\\x80\\x93Â\\xa0it's located in a vibrant neighborhood with lots to do.

I'd happily stay here again! Christopher's place is great. Our family stayed here for almost 5 weeks this summer, and it really became our home away from home. Christopher is an excellent host - left all kinds of supplies (extra toilet paper, cotton balls, earplugs, etc) and was super quick to respond to questions. The neighborhood is perfect. There are TONS of restaurants and bars within a 2 block radius. Only thing to note (which is very common in NYC): Friday and Saturday nights are quite loud until about 3am. There is a bar below the apartment, and the neighborhood is very popular.  Christopher supplied earplugs and a sound machine which helped A LOT. But, if you're sensitive to sound, please keep this in mind. Thanks Christopher!   Brilliant, spotless clean, modern, ridiculously good location - will book again Chris' place is smack dab in the food/bar scene of the Lower East Side and I enjoyed every minute of my time spent here.

The bedroom and bathroom are both very small but all we needed to get a hot shower and good nightâ\\x80\\x99s rest. The bed was comfortable. There is a small window unit A/C which kept it cool enough and also drowned out any noise we might have heard. It  is a shared space but their bedroom and bathroom are downstairs, which made us feel we had our own private space. We really never saw them when we were getting ready in the mornings or evenings.

Stayed in a few Airbnb in NYC and this is my favorite. Friendly, communicative, and sparkling clean - we got a very good night's sleep and a hot shower.  What more can you ask for?  Thanks again! Our first experience with the AirBnb concept. What an experience! My girlfriend and i felt immediately at ease with us. A warm welcome in which Luis has informed us about this. So warmly received with a drink. The location is absolutely perfect, 5 minutes walk to the metro and within 15 minutes we were in Times Square. We have experienced Queens as one of the finer neighborhoods. It was our first time in the USA, New York. The explanation and information previous to us at (thinking of taking the metro & the directions to the apartment) were clear and precisely described! Very helping. The Wi-Fi was perfect!\\n\\nWith a bakery & supermarket around the corner ideal for easy to do some shopping. This coupled with the use of the whole kitchen etc. ideal to also something to eat indoors. Luis was the second week of our stay on holiday, Martha in that time has taken care of us. They took care of a clean household and was there for any questions. We stay for 14 days at this place, after a week Martha cleans or room and take care about the cleaning.\\n\\nIn short; It is an AirBnb which is recommended for everyone! A spacious room (which can be closed, where we all got different keys to close). So you have a private area where you can leave your own stuff. Super friendly, you can ask anything and an ideal location. By Luis we will more often start using the AirBnb concept, the doubts we had in advance are completely gone. Luis and Martha thank you and for every one who reads this, book this AirBnb! \\n\\nGreetz Laura & Mitch I had a great staying in Luis's place. The room is sparkling clean, and I like where the place is at because there are some good cafes that you can chill and have a fun!! I would stay here again.  Estuvimos 10 noches durmiendo en casa de Luis, y para nosotros fue la mejor experiencia posible, nos sentimos como en casa. La llegada fue perfecta, nos retrasamos y nos espero sin ningÃºn problema. La casa estÃ¡ impecable y la habitaciÃ³n es excelente. La ubicaciÃ³n esta a muy poco de la linea 7 que te deja en la 5av o en times square en 10-15 min como mÃ¡ximo. AdemÃ¡s Luis es un fantÃ¡stico host, siempre atento y respondiendo a nuestras dudas y nos ayudÃ³ con la ruta dÃ¡ndonos tips de la ciudad. En resumen, no podrÃ\\xada haber ido mejor, super recomendable. Cuando volvamos a nyc no dudaremos y volveremos a hospedarnos con Luis. 5 estrellas y porque no podemos poner 10. Gracias por todo! Luis Unterkunft ist sehr sauber! Er ist sehr sehr freundlich und entgegenkommend und hilft wo er nur kann. Ich kann es nur weiter empfehlen! Hemos estado dos semanas en casa de Luis. Es una persona superamable y siempre dispuesto a ayudarte. La casa estÃ¡ en un barrio muy tranquilo. Por la noche no habÃ\\xada nada de jaleo y la cama era muy buena, con lo que se podÃ\\xada dormir estupendamente. Se tardaba unos 8 minutos en llegar a la estaciÃ³n de metro y desde ahÃ\\xad habÃ\\xada unos 15 min. a Times Square.

She really takes the time to make her guests feel welcome. She gave me a lot of really great recommendations for places to eat and things to do in the city. Her apartment is located in a really great neighborhood and is accessible to both the ferry and the subway station. The room was very clean and cozy and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Next time Iâ\\x80\\x99m in New York, I would definitely love to stay here again! Lindsey's place is a rare find, and I don't know where to begin with all of all of the wonderful things about my stay here!. First, the location is great: it's on a beautifully quiet street near one of the coolest coffes shops I've been to, but close to a million awesome restaurants, bars, and shops. It's a couple blocks from the nearest subway, bus, and even the ferry into Manhattan. \\n\\nThe room is quite large with a ton of storage space for luggage, and the apartment is beautifully furnished and spotless!  Best of all, Lindsey is one of the most thoughtful hosts and went out of her way to make me feel at home (she even provided coffee and cereal)! It was so nice chatting with her when I had the chance! \\n\\nI worked long hours, and the apartment was really quiet, which made it easy to get a great night's sleep! \\n\\nI would stay here again in a heartbeat! Thanks so much for everything :) \"),\n",

We liked the layout a lot, and there was plenty of room for our family of 6. We finally found the closest metro stop on the last day for getting into the city. It does take a while, but we expected that. \\n\\nAlistair was great about communication! We were a bit off on our arrival times, and he sent the nanny to meet us with the key. He also called to talk through the sleeping arrangements to make sure we had everything we needed. Great communicators, and a lovely home. Thank you! We enjoyed our stay.  The apartment is in a great location and has been recently renovated.  Everything worked as described, and our stay was very comfortable.\\nIt would be helpful to list that it is on the 4th floor.\\nAlso, the listing is not fully accurate.  There are not 2 bedrooms in the front - only the master bedroom is in the front.  The 3rd \"bedroom\" is a sleeper sofa in the common \"family room\" next to the kitchen.    The order of rooms from front to back is:  Master, Living, hall&bath, kids bedroom, family room, kitchen. very nice apartment and a perfect area to visit NYC. very easy to communicate with our hosts. Great experience Beautiful place for a family traveling with kids. Chelsea and Alistair were flexible and great in getting responses back to me.

Pudimos usar la cocina y espacios comunes del departamento sin problemas. Jay fue muy flexible. \\nLo Ãºnico mejorable es que la habitaciÃ³n no tiene aire acondicionado y en verano hace difÃ\\xadcil dormir en la noche. The apartment is walking distance from subway and is in a safe neighbourhood. Jay (and his cat) made our stay very comfortable. Jay is very friendly and quick to respond. I would definitely recommend this place for any one looking for an affordable place for visiting new york.  Staying at Jay's place was great! It is a very central location and can easily get wherever you want in NYC.  Jay's place is a 5-minute walk from a train station and provides all the necessary amenities. It's not amazing but it certainly gets the job done for a reasonable price. It's probably really good for people who are just in town for Yankees games as it is really close to the ballpark. I'd say it is also good for people really trying to explore Manhattan in general. He is an amazing host! He gave us tips what we can do in the city \\n Wir hatten eine schÃ¶ne Zeit in New York - die Wohnung ist ca. 4 Minuten zu FuÃ\\x9f von der nÃ¤chsten U-Bahn entfernt und somit ist man in gut 30 Minuten am Timesquare und ca. 40 Minuten in Lower Manhatten (D oder A = express Linien). Die Wohngegend ist jetzt nicht die schÃ¶nste, aber war in Ordnung. Polizei war immer vor Ort also haben wir uns nie unsicher gefÃ¼hlt. Jay war die meiste Zeit unterwegs, aber alles hat reibungslos funktioniert.  Jay is a nice and friendly host. We felt welcome and were offered a lot of great tips on local places to visit and restaurants to try out. My sister was particularly fond of Jackie, the cat.\\n\\nThe location of the place is quite convenient and safe. It is just a few blocks away from 145th street subway station, and you can hop on the A or C express to get to midtown or lower Manhattan in a few stops. There is also a grocery store nearby, which is ideal for people who travel on a budget. \\n\\nI highly recommend Jay's apartment if you visit NYC. Jay es excelente anfitriÃ³n, estÃ¡ cuando lo necesitas, muy considerado. Las instrucciones son claras y pagas lo justo por lo que ofrece.  Nous avons fait une belle rencontre avec Jay, un hÃ´te attentionnÃ© et trÃ¨s intÃ©ressant.. lâ\\x80\\x99appartement est parfaitement situÃ© Ã\\xa0 Harlem dans Manhattan, Ã\\xa0 proximitÃ© en mÃ©tro des sites intÃ©ressant, en pleine ville dans un environnement animÃ©, et tout prÃ¨s dâ\\x80\\x99un parc, de restaurants et de petits commerces.  Jays place is great for someone looking to explore NewYork and just have a place to crash at the end of the day, the space is small but functional. The neighbourhood does not make you feel uncomfortable at all with star bucks and cute little cafes all on the walk to the subway which is only a few minutes away. The room can get hot during the summer months though as it has no air conditioning and be aware that the apartment is up a few flights of stairs. We enjoyed our stay at Jays and never felt uncomfortable.\"),\n",

The shared bathroom was uncomfortable, especially when I arrived and the shower was clogged from someoneâ\\x80\\x99s hair for two days, and the water didnâ\\x80\\x99t drain properly. The bedroom ac also was hardly pushing out any cold hair, especially on 90degree days it was musky in the living space. The value is decent for what you get. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a place to rest your head, just to visit various locations in New York City. Also had items stolen from me in the bathroom. So I had to bring everything I needed back into my room and lock the door. Itâ\\x80\\x99s what youâ\\x80\\x99d expect from multiple guests sharing a living space.  Good place to stay. You get what you pay for.  L'appartement est bien situÃ©, le quartier est tranquille (attention par contre cet Ã©tÃ© il a des travaux sur les lignes de mÃ©tro proches ce qui ralentit l'accÃ¨s aux stations car remplacÃ© par des navettes/bus). Sinon l'appartement est trÃ¨s bien, la climatisation est un peu vieillot dans la chambre mais c'est correct. Les espaces communs n'Ã©taient pas super propre mais cela est la consÃ©quence de vivre a plusieurs dans l'appartement.\\nSinon super sÃ©jour, j'y retournerai sÃ»rement pour l'emplacement qui est vraiment sympathique.\\n Clean, easy to get to from ferry from the city. Relatively safe neighborhood. Would stay here again! The place was filthy, and smelled dirty. The host was no where in sight. There was garbage on the bathroom floor and the toilet had poop in it. The bathtub looked as thought it hadn't been properly scrubbed in years. There was grime all over the floors and the refrigerator door. The mattress cover had some brown stains on it and the whole place smelled gross. I immediately called airbnb to get a direct refund from them and they gave it to me after providing pictures of the filth in the apartment. If you care about cleanliness at all don't go here. The bathroom felt so gross that my boyfriend refused to use it . Balcony door didnt lock. host refused to fix it and was very hard to contact. had to leave and stay elsewhere as the door couldnt be locked thus leaving it very unsafe to leave belongings there or sleep. Worst Airbnb we have stayed in. The room, bathroom, and common areas were all nice and clean. The place is a little far from the subway, but the Astoria ferry is a short walk away and made it much easier to travel. The apartment was small but cozy. Limited seating in the common area and one bathroom shared between three rooms. Bloz does a very good job of communicating with you if you have any questions & accommodates your arrival and check out time well. nice place to stay in. quite neighborhood\"),\n",

My boyfriend and I were first time users to airb&b and this was the perfect place to start! The walk to Forest Hills stadium was extremely easy, fast and safe. Deborahâ\\x80\\x99s replies were extremely quick and the pictures represent the apartment very well. The entire place was very clean and had everything one would need for a short stay! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a basic apartment who has up to a total of 2 people!  Kay's place was perfect for my needs.  The apartment was clean, quiet, and the internet worked well.  Also, parking was very easy.  The first night I had no problem finding street parking nearby and the second night Kay even let me use her driveway (though street parking was still ample).  I was happy with the location: it is about a 20 minute walk to Austin St, which is the main business street in Forest Hills and also where the subway stops.  Another nice touch was the fact there was some cereal and milk in the kitchen, so I could easily have something small to eat in the morning.\\n\\nI also got to interact with Kay who lives downstairs.  She was great: very kind and friendly. Kay's place is really nice. It is right in the middle of many restaurants, shops etc. It is also a very calm and relaxing neighbourhood, and the interior of the house itself had a really peaceful atmosphere.

She left so many helpful things in the Airbnb that my sister and I didnâ\\x80\\x99t expect. After a long day we were really thankful to find out Randi had left us filtered water to drink from and she provided so many other amenities (bars of soap, metrocards, charging cable, towels, etc).

The space is nice and in a convenient location. Randi's place is great. It was easy to walk to Times Square and Broadway and made going to see a show easy. Randi is a great host and was very helpful with suggestions on where to eat on 9th Ave, as well as places and sights to see. Great apartment close to Times Sq and Subway. Randi was a great host, very responsive. Would definitely recommend this place Relaxed and simple. Overall great stay Exactly as advertised and seen in previous reviews. Great location. Randi was very responsive. Would recommend it a thousand times over. Randi's place is cute, clean and in a great location.

Nice, clean, well equipped place to stay in Manhattan. Great location. Strong A/C was important when we were there. Host is quite responsive.

Tip: for cereal, milk, juice, water, ice cream, etc. at a decent price, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a 24-hour CVS about two blocks away on 2nd at 32nd. Great location! But the pictures are different then real life.pictures make it look big and roomy-itâ\\x80\\x99s sooo tiny.air unit is tiny and old so it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t cool the place!never stay more then 2 people in here. Great location, several things (restaurants & stores) were within walking distance including catching the subway. The AC unit could be updated to a bigger model but other than that my family enjoyed the stay. This place was a perfect stay for New York. The structure of the room is different depending on the amount of people in your group. She provided the right amount of beds and had all the right essentials, and enough for all 5 of us!

The unit is very quiet as it doesn't face the streets. The unit was roomy enough for 3 adults.

We had such a wonderful time at Kinneret's place! The location is nothing short of perfect for spending time in NYC, the place is surprisingly spacious, and it was easy getting to and from there. In addition, it feels like a home - with stocked bookshelves, small decorations and magazines on the desk. Kinneret always responded quickly and was so very helpful the whole time we were planning out stay. We absolutely recommend you stay here if you're going to NYC!  Great stay, great place :) thanks a lot  Her house walks a bit from the station, but it is a quiet and nice place for that. We were able to spend comfortably in very clean apartment. Look no further for your stay in New York! Kinnerets studio apartment was perfect for two people, with everything you could need. She was out of town but made it so easy for us to check in with her lovely friend helping us out! great location - 10 min walk to Central Park & 3 minute walk to closest subway. I had a lovely stay & would definitely stay here again.  Perfect location, and very nice studio. Quiet neighborhood, and Times Square was one stop away on the subway. My sister and I loved it!  Would stay again!  Kinneret's beautiful Upper West Side apartment was nothing short of an added visitor experience on top of it being a restful accommodation for a (couple of) NYC tourist(s). The large, high ceiling-ed, exposed brick studio apartment is nestled on a quiet, brownstone, tree lined street just steps away from all the NYC action you're looking (or not looking) for. The subway is about a 6 minute walk from the apartment, and is a direct line to be as close to the action as you like, or to stay put and explore the surrounding area without having to walk too far to find a haven of good food and city culture. We spent too much money on an unlimited metro pass, as we opted to walk to and from most of our destinations from the apartment. Even walking back to the apartment in the wee hours of the morning was safe and convenient, and very easy to navigate from all parts of the city. I highly recommend this location for it's affordability, comfort, convenience in location, and cleanliness for either your first or forty-first trip to NYC. Check in and out was a breeze and extremely well organized. Kinneret's apartment is great! It is close to the 72nd subway station, clean and spacious. I would love to stay there again.  We loved our stay at Kinneret's! The place is perfect for a couple travelling - spacious, clean, great location, and everything you could need! Kinneret was away when we arrived, but communicated check-in and apartment-specific info in advance and helped us coordinate check-in with a friend of hers. Everything was a breeze! Really can't say enough good things about our stay - thank you Kinneret! Our stay was great. The location of the studio was perfect, in a great neighborhood.\"),\n",

       "  'La experiencia en general fue buena, esperÃ¡bamos tardar 40 minutos en llegar a Manhattan pero la realidad es que una vez dentro del metro se llega en 25-minutos pero el detalle es que la zona no es la mejor pero la atenciÃ³n de Dean y su familia fue muy buena y el departamento a pesar de ser chico es funcional si no quieres pagar mucho por el hospedaje  Great location, especially for games at Yankee stadium! I don\\'t know where to start. The first impression was nice, as we got down on the Yankee Stadium metro stop, but as we got closer to the house, we started to feel more unsafe, and when we asked the cops if the place was safe, they literally said \"unless one of you knows how to fight, the best thing would be not to walk through this street\". As we arrived home, the host told us that we would share the house with another people that lived there, but we could watch the TV in the dining room. Well, the first time I went out of thw room to watch the TV, i found the woman that lived there doing awkward fotos to herself, but I\\'d better not get in detail, so we decided we would not watch the TV during our stay. So at this point, we knew that we would only use the house to sleep, as the host told us not to use the kitchen for \"heavy cooking\", and the kitchen was barely big enough for the three of us. Nevertheless, one morning we decided to try and have a nice breakfast on the kitchen, and what a surprise when we saw a rat running to a corner. Disgusting.\\nIn conclusion, the best thing about the rental was the price, which got balanced by all the taxis we used to get home safely. So if your idea is just to sleep there, you can do that, but I wouldn\\'t reccommend the experience to anyone. It was a good stay and dean was very nice.  The private room was clean as well.

It does have a separate door to get in. It is also very nicely designed. Since it is located in the basement you could hear some noises from upstairs but I feel like thatâ\\x80\\x99s reasonable and they were never to loud. The apartment looked like the pictures that were posted, very nice and very, very clean. Maybe the cleanest Airbnb you will find anywhere. \\nKarilyn is a very nice host and tried to make us feel comfortable. Although she does have some reasonable House rules like using socks or slippers on the floor or putting blankets over the couch to not make it dirty, for some parts I felt like I was very cautious to not get anything dirty in here. \\n\\nAlso one thing which I wondered about was that the description said the bedroom had a twin bed with a trundle, which was in fact there- but I did ended up sleeping on a blow up mattress (a fairly nice one) next to the bed and my brother on the couch (not pulled out). \\n\\nOverall I did had a good experience even though I felt catious during my stay.

Leaving the premises was easy because the 2 front doors lock on there own. We also drove to the Airbnb which had free street parking except for Tuesday and Thursdays, something like 8am to 11am, on one side of the street which had clean up early morning.

Central Park is 2 blocks away.\\nThe negative point would be the bathroom which is very very old. Thanksfully despite the other guests we never had to wait or line up to go shower.\\nThe place was quiet and we were not disturbed by the street noise (anyways youâ\\x80\\x99re in New York, expect to hear trafic and a bit of noise!). We slept very well. \\nPaulâ\\x80\\x99s indication were very clear and it was easy to check in.\\nThe girl who cleans and prepares the rooms is very nice! Interesting initial instructions on the location. Overall good experience with a very reasonable price! Would recommend. Paulâ\\x80\\x99s place was the perfect stay in Manhattan, I found it very convenient to get almost everywhere in the city.The space was clean and private and I really appreciated all the information Paul provided before the stay.I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to NYC:)! Great location, but very noisy due to construction. Check in is at a nearby spot, so somewhat inconvenient for our late arrival. Paul runs his Airbnb like a hostel (which is not clear in the listing) with at least 5 bedrooms inside the unit sharing just 1 bathroom. Although Paul is really nice, he cuts major corners on cleanliness. We were there when he flipped our room;  he changed the sheets on our bed but he didn't replace the blanket - all kinds of things clung to it from previous guests and we didn't feel comfortable using it during our extended stay. Everything was dusty and the floors/rug were dirty. The bedroom door didn't actually close (rendering the lock useless) and any of our items could've been taken at any time. The bathroom, unfortunately, was the worst part. It reeked of waste and was extremely grimy. The state of the shower honestly makes it uncleanable (unless it is replaced) and all the surfaces (especially the floor) were dirty. Be prepared to wait for the bathroom in mornings and evenings. I understand that some things are tough to maintain with so many guests coming and going and we definitely aren't clean freaks... but when the basic stuff (like bed linens and bathroom) are left completely unclean, it doesn't make for a great stay... It was super convenient for our odd and last minute plans! This is a decent place with great connectivity to most of the tourist places. All it takes is around 30 to 45 minutes via metro to reach all major attractions. Room was clean with basic amenities like AC, dresser, decent mattress, dryer etc. Bath room is shared and you may wanna wake up early to get easy access or wake up late. Paulâ\\x80\\x99s place was convenient and close to the subway station. Check in process was easy. Air con was also available in the room which was great. Gut fÃ¼r low budget in new york This is a one bedroom in a 4 bedroom with only one bathroom. A great location. Only a couple blocks to the 6 and q. Fairly quiet and had its own window unit so you could control the air. I recommend this place! El lugar es lo que se ve. Funciona mu bien y vale la pena a por el dinero y comodidad  The apartment has a great location. The other points could be better. At the end it was a good experience. It's really important to read well the mail Paul send you. Easy check in and check out, really great location! Good location in  Manhattan,   while lacking in maintenance and  cleanness in some facilities.  Comfortable,  if it is not overcrowded. Shower was broken and bathroom was dirty. Metro was close.

The apartment was so cute and it was perfect for our needs. Kaya is a super responsive and attentive host. Awesome spot for couples.  Looks 10x times better in person. Great area, on a quiet street. Parking sucks though, I recommend parking your car in the 24hr lot if you don't want to deal with the hassle. The garage charged me about $47 considering my car was oversized (Highlander), then uberpooled my way around the city. \\n\\nOther than that, I highly recommend this place. Only thing that threw me off a bit was the dust collecting around the tub. I'm a clean freak so to some it doesn't matter, but to me a shiny bathroom, floors, counter tops,  makes the biggest of differences. other than that, I absolutely loved the place. Would definitely come back. Overall Great Host.  Superbe appartement, trÃ¨s bien placÃ©, Ã\\xa0 cÃ´tÃ© du mÃ©tro, dans un quartier trÃ¨s vivant Kayaâ\\x80\\x99s place was exactly as pictured.

I would definitely recommend her place to anyone considering a stay!  Perfect location, close to subway, lots of cafes and shops. Easy check-in, good communication, cozy and artsy apartment, safe neighborhood. Loved it! The place is great! Such a great balcony and so close to central park. The apartments was really nice even though it was a little small. We couldn't get the TV to work but that was the only issue. Perfect for 2 people!  Kayaâ\\x80\\x99s apartment was very clean and a great value. The neighbourhood was quiet and also had everything you would need. The Lexington ave subway line is easily accessible and its also a reasonable biking distance to downtown. Overall the apartment is a great location, and is decorated really nicely. Kaya is a friendly host who wants the best experience for her guests!  Good location, small but all basics provided and excellent communication with Kaya. Kayaâ\\x80\\x99s place was clean, the bedding was comfortable, and the patio was a relaxing escape with pretty views of the surrounding buildings. It was also very quiet. Manhattan is busy and we heard nothing at night with the fan on. Also the artwork is really cool. Definitely recommend! Kaya was very nice and responsive. The place is in a good location, check in and out were smooth. Air con a little noisy. I think the price is a little high for value.. but itâ\\x80\\x99s good as a place to sleep. My wife and I had a wonderful and comfortable stay at Kaya's place. The place is very clean and tidy. The art pieces and decor make the place very cozy. If you haven't lived in Manhattan before, do not be surprised by the small kitchen, small bathroom, and tight spaces. We've lived in Manhattan before, so that doesn't bother us. Location is perfect for us, and its proximity to subway was key (only 3 blocks from the new Q train station). We also felt very safe in the area. Kaya was very good at communicating and answer questions. Kaya was also very accommodating with check-in and check-out times, especially when our flights got affected by Hurricane Florence. \\n\\nMy only suggestions are: \\n- There was an iron, but no ironing board (unless there was one and we just couldn't find it at all). \\n- Wish there was a power socket in the bathroom for using the hair dryer, but I understand that's just how the apartment is, and might be out of Kaya's control.

However,  they are extremely particular about their home so if you have young children or are looking for a homey experience this may not be the place for you. Itâ\\x80\\x99s more like staying in a museum- security guards included. They sent us a bill after checkout for over 2,000 dollars and said they would send another related to steaming their sofa and other activities related to what we consider routine cleaning after guest departures. The tenant downstairs is also pretty uptight. That said, itâ\\x80\\x99s a spacious and clean house but not suitable for young families or anyone not up for walking around on eggshells.  The pictures do not do the place justice. Plenty of space and great location! The place is lovely and very spacious, just as you can see in pictures. The neighborhood is very beautiful and I felt very safe. I walked at night from the subway alone and it was OK. Also, it is 10 minutes away from the subway, but it's like 45 min from Manhattan (trains can take their time to get to the station and you have to consider rush hours, delays, etc), so it may be exhausting sometimes, specially if you walk a lot during the day and then want to get out at night!

The location is amazing, in a quiet street but close enough to shops and the subway, well positioned half way through Manhattan.

Cute place, clean, but something else. Host has to go to work and making all that noise back and forth to get ready, bathroom, kitchen. No good rest at all. And it was extremously HOT! No privacy. If you were late the night before and need to sleep late, Imposible. Good thing was is closed to public transportation (metro)just walking distance.  Be aware. Michelleâ\\x80\\x99s place is immaculate! From the cleanliness to her own personal style, I was in love with her space. She gave me helpful tips in navigating my way around the city. She was so prompt in her replies too. I was there for a wedding so we barely ran into each other but it was nice to come back to an inviting place. The bed was so comfortable! I would stay here again if I had the opportunity. Not only is this place gorgeously decorated, it is also perfectly situated in a greatly interesting neighbourhood and close to the subway, Manhattan and other cool parts of the city. Michelle is very quick in communicating, a little issue I had with the bath was very quickly resolved because of that. Even though I was sleeping in her living room, I felt private enough and very easy to relax. Definitely recommend! Michelle was super lovely and accomodating with great communication. The place was clean and a little bigger than I expected. Sofa bed wasn't particularly comfortable but still worth it for the price. Michelle went out of her way to be accomodating and I would definitely stay again! :) I would definitely reccomend Michelleâ\\x80\\x99s place! She is a terrific host and she made me feel very comfortable at her apartment. The place is basically few minutes away from the subway station and 2 stations away from Manhattan. The area is very safe and right in the next building there is a nice place to eat or get a drink. Thank you, Michelle!! Michelle's apartment is absolutely gorgeous. The two cats she adopted are absolute sweethearts, very playful and affectionate. The location is fabulous and great for accessing a range of different areas in New York. Michelle was amazing and allowed me to check in around 7am as my flight arrived really early in the morning. It was fabulous to have such an accommodating host.  Well, I will try to be nice because Michelle actually tried. But as another review said before: it really isn't a Private Room !!, you're sleeping in the living room. Being misled by the description itself wasn't a problem for me, my problem was that the cats were sleeping in my room. So after having been travelling for 26+ hours the cats just wouldn't let me sleep, jumping on my bed, running around, scratching on my blanket, playing with it. I'm fine with cats, but I was expecting Michelle to be a little more considerate when I texted her asking if she could take them in her room for the night, she simply said they're not used to it and offered to give me earplugs (???).... In the end, after having to ask twice, she took the cats in her room for the night. The night after I decided to sleep somewhere else because the chemistry was just not there and I was just not going to sleep on that VERY hard bed again with cats jumping on it. Other than all of that it was really clean and nicely decorated. So choosing this Airbnb you will just have to adjust to a lot of things, be flexible, love cats, like hard beds and be willing (for that price) to sleep in the living room. I probably wouldn't go there again. A fantastic apartment in a great location (across the road from the nearest subway station with Manhattan under a 10 minute ride away). Also easy to reach via public transport from JFK. \\nAs a solo female traveller I felt very safe in the area, even at night. \\nMichelle was a lovely host; we got on really well and she was always willing to make my stay more comfortable. (Her kittens were super cute as well)! Lovely room in a stylish flat. Super safe neighborhood, perfect location.  Michelle is friendly and open. Iâ\\x80\\x99d love to come back and stay here again :)\\nThe cats are marvelous, love them both!!!\"),\n",

       "  \"Niki & Jinghui's apartment was well located in Hell's Kitchen near a bunch of great theaters, shopping, and restaurants. The apartment itself was comfortable for 7 guests to stay (3 on King, 2 on the other 2 beds) but I would not recommend more than that (the couch is a bit short for an adult to sleep). The apartment had a full kitchen and great air conditioning. The check-in/check-out processes were a bit frustrating because of host unresponsiveness (we had some questions at check-in time but no responses for 2 hours before check-in; they said to ask if we needed to stow luggage and we asked to no response). Also, unfortunately, one of our friends got bug bites at the BnB that look like mite/bedbug bites from the queen-sized bedroom (confirmed with dermatologist) -- the hosts could not have foreseen this happening but I hope that it is taken care of before other guests stay. Overall, this was a nice spot and Niki/Jinghui were nice hosts but I would not stay here again. Great spot.  Stylish apartment just blocks from everything.  The apartment was spacious and had a great New York atmosphere.    This is a great place to stay in NYC - clean, plenty of space, great amenities & close to everything.  Niki was easy to work & communicate with - especially letting us drop our bags off early.  The terrace was a great space to have coffee in the morning.  Lots of good restaurants close by & close to the theatres for Broadway shows.  There were hairdryers, soap & shampoo available - even extras like coffee and snacks.  Very thoughtful:)  We will definitely stay again - thanks so much! Hi, we stayed at the apartment for 5 nights and we enjoyed it a lot. Our party of 7 (including 3 kids) fit perfectly in the three bedrooms. Full of amenities and consumables of good quality and a perfect location very near the subway and Times Square. I recommend this apartment a lot. The place was just how it looked in the pictures and spacious for an NYC apartment. It was also a good location and not very noisy at all. Would stay here again if I'm in the area. Great central location.  Easy access to Times Square and subway.  Beds are very comfortable.  Tight living quarters but probably considered spacious for NYC.  Good communication. A terrific find! The host was spot-on professional, very responsive and met all our expectations, including being flexible when we had to change our flights last minute. The space is perfect - three bedrooms were such a luxury and everything was clean. Definitely recommend! Great location close to Times Square!  Nice to have 2 bathrooms We stayed with a group of seven for a Birthday celebration weekend. This apartment is suitable for six people comfortably. There was an air mattress provided that had a leak, so a new air mattress or bringing a twin mattress would allow for seven more comfortably.\\nThe apartment was a private and decent distance from Times Square.  It was approximately a 15 to 20 minutes walk or a cab/Uber of $10. The apartment is relatively quiet, with more street noise in the front bedroom compared to the back two.\\nThe layout of the apartment, three bedrooms and two full bathrooms with an equipped kitchen was ideal for a New York weekend. The beds are so comfortable I might buy one.\\nWe would not hesitate to recommend this property and/or book again. Excellent! Niki made everything very easy and convenient for us, and was extremely responsive with messages. The location is unbeatable as well! Spacious place, very central and convenient to local restaurants/bars and shops. Host very responsive to any questions. We enjoyed our stay. It is a great location for theater and time square. The host is great. The beds are comfortable. 3 couples stayed at this airbnb for a wedding in Manhattan. It was very clean and we even got to check-in early and check-out late no problem. The location is great, walking distance to Time Square. I would definitely stay here again. We enjoyed our stay. The location was perfect for our annual Broadway trip. We only had to walk about 10 minutes to each theater and had so many delicious dining options in Hellâ\\x80\\x99s Kitchen along the way. The bedrooms are very comfortable with their own, adjustable AC. The two bathrooms are accessed from the main room, which was ideal. Nikki was a very responsive host. thumbs Great apartment, large enough to hold 6 or more with 2 bathrooms which is unheard of in NYC! Near all the action of Times Square. Niki is a wonderful host. She'll help with whatever you need!\"),\n",

Gulcin kindly allowed my friend and I to check in early, seeing that we had arrived in the city earlier in the morning. The apartment was walking distance to Chinatown where there were great eats. Great location!  This place is good location & could be worth it. However, all guests must know this is a 4 floor walk up. If you have suitcases & over 30 good luck!!! The stairway was extremely dirty & v. unpleasant to walk up. A simple clean up such as sweeping would of made a big difference. Within the apt. my biggest disappointment was the host had a young kid come to clean, he had no idea how to clean a bathroom which I had to do myself. During my stay the toilet got clogged up due to \"kid cleaner\" hired by host, throwing hair & papertowel in bowl. Then I of the 7 guests did a disgusting mess in toilet making it unpleasant for everyone. The host needs to be more hands on, during my ck. in she was away in Fl. then came for 2days & again left for Turkey for a month according to her. My advice to this host is if you are not staying on property while guests are coming & going, you need to hire a professional cleaner so your guests can have a clean stay. I love this place!!! It is good place to stay Gulcin is a very nice and helpful host.   The apartment is set in the perfect location within walkable distance from major Manhattanâ\\x80\\x99s landmarks. Moreover the neighborhood is safe. The room we lived in is very cosy and clean. We had even been greeted with a tea and candies. We are already thinking about coming back to NYC and for sure we are to choose Gulcinâ\\x80\\x99s apartment. Highly recommended! Cozy and affordable room in Chinatown.

AuÃ\\x9ferdem haben wir es genoÃ\\x9fen nicht wirklich in einer Tourigegend zu sein, sondern unter den Locals.  Extras wie dass fÃ¼rs FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck etwas da ist, machen euch als Airbnb besonders. Macht weiter so!!! ganz liebe GrÃ¼Ã\\x9fe von den Austrian Siblings My husband and I had a wonderful stay in one of Sandra & Hansâ\\x80\\x99s nicely furnished and decorated rooms for four days in July 2018. We were in NYC to visit family and are very glad we discovered this place.\\nThe room and the house is exactly as advertised and shown in the pictures. The larger than expected room has a very chic vintage vibe, is very clean, nicely decorated, has plenty of space for storage and hanging your clothes and offers a very comfy bed. We felt at home right a way. Many nice touches, like soothing music in our room at our late arrival, a small kitchen with everything you need for a light breakfast and a well stocked adorable bathroom made our stay very comfortable.\\nHans and Sandra are exceptional hosts. They always responded very quickly to our answers and were very kind even when we arrived later than anticipated. They always went to great lengths to make us feel comfortable and welcome. Wonderful conversations, their adorable little son and the two beautiful, lovely cats made our stay even more feeling at home.\\nWe discovered that Staten Island has much more to offer than we expected, with several museums and parks and even a very long boardwalk and beach. We especially loved the Alice Austen House, including the beautiful views.\\nThere is a bus stop close to Hans & Sandraâ\\x80\\x99s home which you can take to go to the Staten Island Ferry. But we used the car and parked it in the parking lot near the ferry. Parking costs are only $8 for the whole day including a free shuttle service to the ferry. Just write down the shuttles phone number, so that you can call them to pick you up when you arrive late at night. What a great deal! \\nThe free ferry takes ca. 20 minutes to lower Manhattan, with amazing views of the Statue of Liberty & the NYC Skyline. When coming back, even late, we always were able to find a parking spot quite close to the house and we always felt very safe, even when coming home late at night.\\n\\nWe had a great stay at Hans & Sandraâ\\x80\\x99s home, loved to meet both, we felt comfortable, safe and at home and definitely would like to stay with them again. If youâ\\x80\\x99re considering staying here but not 100% sure, let me give you some advice: book with Sandra and Hans. They are warm, kind, funny people and the house is absolutely perfect. Nearby the ferry terminal which gets you to Manhattan in 25 minutes, but far enough from the city to be a sanctuary after a day of sightseeing. The bed is huge and so comfortable, and the kitchen has all the basics you need. The perfect place to see New York from :) Toller Aufenthalt, super Gastgeber ! Es hat uns so gut gefallen das wir auf jeden Fall wieder kommen. 5 Sterne von uns !  Sehr nette Gastgeber und top Zimmer! Das Bett war super bequem, sehr sauber.

Alles in einem haben wir es sehr genossen da. \\nWir haben beschlossen vom JFK Flughafen selber anzureisen. Seid gewarnt, wenn man sich nicht auskennt, dauert das gute 4 Stunden. Zum GlÃ¼ck bietet Hans einen Abholservice an, den ihr in ErwÃ¤gung ziehen kÃ¶nnt. \\nAnsonsten war die Verbindung von deren Zuhause nach Manhattan sehr gut zu erreichen. Es dauert ein bisschen bis man sich merkt, wo die richtige Busstation zum aussteigen ist. Mit dem Bus fÃ¤hrt man ca. 15 Minuten und die FÃ¤hre fÃ¤hrt ca. 25 Minuten. Wir liebten es die FÃ¤hre zu nehmen, nicht nur weil sie kostenlos ist, sondern weil man auch jedes Mal einen anderen Blick auf die Skyline Manhattans oder die Freiheitsstatue bekommt! Es lohnt sich also wirklich. This place is what makes staying in Airbnbs so great. The rooms had wonderful character, and the small touches provided by Sandra and Hand made it very personable.  The commute to NYC was one of the highlights, traveling past the statue of liberty on our way into the city. Despite being 1hr away from Manhattan we still made it out to Broadway and explored the city at night. it was also a bonus that we could park the car next to house.\\n Wir hatten einen schÃ¶nen Aufenthalt bei Sandra und Hans und haben uns sehr wohl gefÃ¼hlt. Sie haben uns bei Fragen immer weitergeholfen, die nette Hauskatze hat uns tÃ¤glich besucht und das Haus ist sehr schÃ¶n eingerichtet. Danke fÃ¼r den tollen Aufenthalt! Das war jetzt mein 2. Besuch bei Sandra&Hans und bestimmt nicht mein letzter :) Perfect!!!! Polecam fajna lokalizacja, miÅ\\x82y gospodarz, We had a great stay with Hans and Sandra, the location is a convenient place with good bus connection to the ferry. if you choose to stay on Staten Island this is a great place.'),\n",

The room was quite warm and stuffy when we arrived, but once we turned the air conditioning on (window unit, you have control over it), it felt great. The bathrooms are quite small, wasn\\'t much of an issue except the one was extremely warm. If you need more than one towel, do pack your own. Beds were very comfortable though!

But I dont remember it being noisy. Bien placÃ© pour aller Ã\\xa0 Manhattan. La chambre est petite, assez basique, mais lumineuse et le lit est confortable.  La ubicaciÃ³n es buena pero el baÃ±o no estaba del todo limpio. El dÃ\\xada que llegamos la papelera estaba llena y despuÃ©s de una semana allÃ\\xad seguÃ\\xada rebosando de basura y sin cambiar la bolsa  I booked this room because I\\'d read there was an air-conditioner in the room: there was, and it felt great to crank it up! Bed was also comfy. Our room was on the front of the house, so we had a nice view, including the view of the firehouse across the street. There was plenty of room in the fridge and the fridge was very clean. There are four airbnb rooms upstairs, each door with its own lock, and two bathrooms. There\\'s a microwave, toaster, coffeemaker, and wifi. I wish we\\'d had a way to boil water (I guess the microwave was ok for that). We had 2 bath towels: I\\'d recommend bringing your own hand towel and washcloth. \\nThe neighborhood feels safe and is pretty quiet. We were there for a whole week, so we took the subway every day and walked \"home\" each night. The fire truck only sounded its siren maybe twice in a week, so that was not an issue. It was extremely hot this week, so when we\\'d come in the house each night, the house itself (and the bath) was hot--taking a shower helped, and some nights and mornings the temperature was okay, but the common areas are basically kind of humid. There\\'s no living room area for guests, I wish there had been, but for the price, the location and amenities were a good value. \\nNote: when we first arrived, (Hidden by Airbnb) maps told us to take the E train to Queens Plaza. After that, though, we found that 36 St (R and M trains) is actually the closer stop.  Amazing location and great value for money if you\\'re planning on visiting NYC.  The apartment is 2 blocks away from the subway station which gets you into the city in less than 15 minutes.  The price you pay is an amazing deal considering how expensive new york city is.  If you\\'re looking for luxury then this is probably not for you and you should be prepared to spend a lot more.  However, if you\\'re looking for a clean and quiet place to rest your head then this is for you.  Bathroom was super clean! Clean, convenient (30min to midtown), and great value POINTS NÃ\\x89GATIFS : \\n-L\\'appartement (qui est un logement partagÃ©) Ã\\xa0 Ã©tÃ© pour nous une assez mauvaise expÃ©rience, car lors de notre arrivÃ©e nous avons constatÃ© que les draps n\\'avaient pas Ã©tÃ© changÃ© (tÃ¢ches et poils) nous avons contactÃ© l\\'hÃ´te qui nous as simplement changÃ© la housse de couette...\\n- La salle de bain Ã©tait assez sale (poussiÃ¨re, cheveux, poils). \\n- Malheureusement en dÃ©but de semaine nous avons partagÃ© le logement avec des \"colocataires\" trÃ¨s trÃ¨s bruyant.\\n\\nPOINTS POSITIFS : \\n- LÃ©o nous Ã\\xa0 donnÃ© un code d\\'accÃ¨s pour l\\'appartement ce qui est assez pratique pour l\\'arrivÃ©e au logement.\\n- Plusieurs arrÃªts de Metro Ã\\xa0 proximitÃ© (5 min Ã\\xa0 pied pour le plus prÃ¨s)\\n- Ã\\xa0 20 min en mÃ©tro de Manhattan.\\n\\nCONCLUSION : \\nLogement plutÃ´t sale, bruyant (pompier juste en face) mais bien placÃ© et Ã\\xa0 un prix abordable.'),\n",

Fuimos con mi beba y nos encontramos con que nos habia conseguido una practicuna, un gesto muy bueno. Great location and hospitality. Host replies promptly and is very easy to work with. We would pick this place again if we ever come back to NYC. Great host! Communication was excellent. The location was walking distance to Time Square. We had such a nice time. Excellent accommodations!  Very clean and stocked with the essentials.  Great location too.  Anything we needed was a short walk away.  Easy subway access to all sites throughout the city.  One bedroom was not for light sleepers, with some routine street noise, but did not bother our crew at all.  Highly recommend! Sebastianâ\\x80\\x99s place is stylish, clean and comfortable.  The neighborhood feels safe and access to public transportation is a few blocks away. The listing and photos are accurate and communication is responsive. We would be happy to stay at Sebastianâ\\x80\\x99s again! muy buena ubicacion te permite caminar a todos lados o tomar el transporte publico. muchos restaurantes cerca que te hacen la estancia simple y deliciosa y un supermercado muy bien surtido a unas cuadras. la limpieza muy bien. el unico detalle es el ruido en la recamara que da a la calle pero eso no esta bajo control del lugar. whilst the location on 9th avenue is good being on walking distance to times square, metro stations, small supermarkets and a variety of restaurants, the main serious draw back of this appartment is the extreme noise coming from the street almost all night long. you have to be a strong sleeper not to suffer from lack of sleep - as we had to deal with. with the lack of sun light in the appartment, you may question the value/price relation. A very clean, and comfortable apartment, just 15 minutes from Times Square and 10 minutes from subway stations. Despite being on 9th Avenue, once in the apartment we found it pretty quiet. Recommended. Great location in the heart of Hellâ\\x80\\x99s Kitchen. Close to Broadway, Times Square and lots of nice restaurants.\\n\\nAs for the apartment itself:\\n1. It is a bit dark (not a major issue)\\n2. Of the bedrooms faces 9th avenue which makes it very noisy. \\n3. Plumbing issues. Judging by the plunger in the bathroom (which we actually had to use) we are not the first to encounter this. The location was perfect was able to walk every where, easy access to subway, very clean and well maintained would highly recommend this place You may expect quick replies to your questions, accommodations exactly as pictured and itâ\\x80\\x99s located in a perfect area of NYC.

The Apartment is very comfy and has lots of space for everyone to relax.  We will definitely be staying with Eti again. Great place in a good location. Easily walkable to many sights, restaurants, bars, and attractions. Anything out of walking distance is easily accessible with close public transportation. This was a great size accommodation for 3 couples coming from different states to stay and enjoy time together in the common areas and each have our own privacy. Eti was very responsive and easy to work with. Amazing home and amazing location. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in TriBeCa. The home is located within walking distance of restaurants, grocery stores, and the subway. The home is exceptionally clean and the open floor plan made it comfortable for all. We had a fantastic time.  Eti's place is in an amazing Tribeca location and close to all the great bars and restaurants that Tribeca is known for.  I was staying with a group of colleagues for a business conference and we found the space was big enough to accommodate all 5 of us and the wifi was solid when all of us were working at the same time.  The only issue we faced was that the check-in and check-out processes were a bit inconvenient.  Overall I would definitely recommend Eti's place for a group traveling to NYC! Amazing value for this great 4 bedroom apartment. Nine of us (two families) stayed there for 5 night and felt very comfortable. The location is amazing with attractions in walking distance and all subways in close proximity. Check in and out was great and communication was perfect. Highly recommended. The apartment is in a great location and it is very spacious/nicely decorated. The issue that we had (which was a pretty big one) is that the apartment was listed as having elevator access when in fact the elevator did not work. We were also told that it would be in working order but it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t throughout our stay. We had persons in our group who were physically handicapped & one very pregnant woman who had to go up FIVE flights of stairs. It made for an uncomfortable stay as we couldnâ\\x80\\x99t go in and out freely with the entire group.  Huge, clean apartment, Eti was very responsive to messages and everyone in our group absolutely loved the space. The elevator is an amazing extra. I very much reccommend. Very nice apartment in good location at Tribeca. Excellent host great place and great value in Tribeca area. The location is close to everything but the building itself needs works.  Two bathrooms door unable to lock and one unable to close all the way, leaving a gap in between the door.   Thereâ\\x80\\x99s fleas under the blankets, we have to put it in the washer to wash it prior of use. The apartment was nice and I loved the openness of the kitchen/living room. However, the apartment could use a few updates:\\n\\nThe elevator did not work causing a major issue for several of friends traveling with us who had a difficult time climbing the 5 flights of stairs. \\nThe bathroom door does not close completely. \\nThe electrical outlet did not work in one bathroom. \\nSheets were not on one bed. \\nA broken bed in the room with 2 beds. \\nCould use more mirrors in bedrooms. The location is so excellent. You can walk to wall street and 911 square. The apartment is on the fifth floor of the building, it is not easy to find. The building is very old. Staying at Etiâ\\x80\\x99s place was awesome. The description and pictures are exactly as shown. It was very spacious and clean and accommodated our group of 10.

Christopher was very easy to work with and very accommodating when I needed to add extra days on to the girls' stay at his apartment.  He always answered any of my questions in a very timely manner.  He made sure to be there when the girls first arrived to give them a key, show them the apartment, and answer any questions.  The apartment was very clean and comfortable.  The location is great!   It is very close to Target, Whole Foods and close to major subway terminals.  This made it very easy to travel to and from Manhattan- sometimes twice a day.  I highly recommend this place for a stay and can't wait to stay there myself when I'm in New York.\"),\n",

       "  \"The place is located in a very convenient spot if you are planning on using the subway. Jon is a nice guy. He is mostly never there so it feels as if you have the whole place to yourself. \\n\\nBeing said that I have some important remarks to make.  We went during the summer so it was very hot since there's no AC in the place. The place was clean except for the toilet which it seemed like it hadn't been cleaned in at least a couple of weeks. I don't want to get into details but I think a week-long guest paying more than $500 deserves a freshly cleaned toilet. The deal breaker for me was that I encountered a mouse on two different occasions: first in the kitchen and then in our bedroom. When in the bedroom, the mouse actually ran over my feet which was a very unpleasant experience. I briefly tried to find it and kill it to no avail. I didn't mention anything to anybody since I didn't want my wife to freak out and have her want to leave to a different place or something. However, a day or two after that we found holes that match with what mice do when they bite your clothes, so she did find out and had trouble sleeping the last two nights. \\n\\nI must say that Jon was frequently texting me the whole week to make sure things were ok, and I didn't mention anything about the mouse to him. It was honestly awkward and I didn't know how I was going to affect the rest of our stay if I brought it up. But I do think that potential guest must know about the situation and Jon should work on getting the mice issue fixed Jon is a great host who is always available by message when we need it. We donâ\\x80\\x99t see him a lot because of his work, but it was not a problem, he answered to our questions by messages if we needed. The bed was very comfortable. The flat is very close to the subway station and, this ligne can bring you in  every famous place in NYC. Besides, Jon was flexible for our check in and check out. I recommend ! Jon is an amazing host! He is very friendly. His place is very clean and close to the subway. It was very easy to navigate. Would definitely stay again! Jon was great! Super flexible and kind. He made my stay smooth and relaxing. I would recommend to anyone looking for a piece of mind.  Stay was alright. No issues. Host was really helpfull.  My first experience at Airbnb and I was very well received. Thank you, Jon! clean cozy apartment which is very close to midtown Manhattan. swift response and very friendly host. great experience. Jon's place was great - close to many subway lines and bus routes so it's very easy to get around. Jon was very accommodating with both check in and check out times which was extremely appreciated. Would definitely recommend to anyone and would stay there again myself!  Nice place, with easy access to 3 train It was a great place to stay in New York. The room was totally clean as Jon describes.

I had great time at there. Very clean and quiet place, good location, near to the subway, police station, food market. Definitely recommend it . Jon was extremely helpful! Responds immediately and was quick to give information and tips! His place was extremely clean and even had a smart TV in the room! His location is prime for someone who wants very quick access to Central Park/times square via a quick and easy subway ride that was a 2 minute walk from his location. When we return to NYC we will without a doubt be staying here again. HIGHLY recommend to anyone who wants a good value with a great location! Thanks Jon!\"),\n",

It's such a cool vibe and great location (it's about a 5 minute walk to the subway and a total 30-40 minute commute to Manhattan). The AC was key traveling there in September. She also let us drop our bags off early so we didn't have to carry it around everywhere. I highly recommend this spot if you're traveling to NYC. I could not recommend this place more highly. It's exactly what the photos look like, maybe even better. It's right by a park and isn't on a busy road so it's nice and quite for New York, but still benefits from being close to the L train. The bed was super comfortable, and I really enjoyed lounging around the place in between exploring the city. Amanda was also an incredible host and responded very quickly to all inquiries.

We had a great time staying here! The place was stylish and clean! The train station is right down the street and there are a bunch of restaurants and shops near by. Great location (friendly neighborhood)! Place was great as described, great location  It cost more than it has. There was no washing machine, no bin. So we had to pay another money to have our clothes clean and fresh. We also hadto pay late check in fee. It was not our fault because i was raining and our flight was delayed. There were uncomfortable beds. Too soft for us. Wifi was not stable. There weno no fresh air in the apartman even we had open windows all day. There was fug inside.

Olgaâ\\x80\\x99s place was very clean and in a great location. However, we arrived at 8:45pm and waited a few minutes to meet up with a woman (who was not Olga) to give us the keys. She walked us up to the apartment and showed us around the space. At 9:03, she required a $50 cash fee to be paid on the spot for a late check in since it was after 9:00pm. This information is hard to find on the house rules and was not communicated to us directly and they also knew we were driving in and could hit traffic. I also was uncomfortable that the woman asked me to go to an ATM and get cash. Other than the check-in trouble, everything was great.  Great place Olga was difficult to communicate with; first she didnâ\\x80\\x99t read my messages about coming a day late... then was not very accommodating in terms of meeting for keys. Water started steaming through bathroom ceiling at midnight on first night. She told us not to bother upstairs people and that she would call super in morning. Meanwhile every time upstairs people took shower, water came through into\\nOur sink and toiletries- was not repaired and following night same thing happened. Meanwhile 5 people trying to get ready for our sons wedding with the few towels left after cleaning up link. This leak is clearly something that happens on a regular basis - we saw the repair materials under kitchen sink. \\nWhile it was a lovely apt, the host was terrible.

Becky was super fast and accommodating. Enjoyed the stay.  The place was cute, definitely a little gem like she described. Close to parking and plenty of corner stores nearby. Only complaint is that we agreed on an early check-in and then she told us we couldnâ\\x80\\x99t do that anymore at the last minute after we already booked. Waited hours for a confirmation for when we could check in and it was difficult to get a hold of her. The actually apartment was small, but very cozy and in a good location.  Becky's place was where it said it was and her description of her place was spot on. We had the whole place to ourselves and it was very discreet, clean and private. If you need anything she is very accommodating and knows whats going on in the city. A great host and a great spot to call home for a few days! Beckyâ\\x80\\x99s place was in a great location with lots of options for food and shopping. It was also very close to transportation. Our only complaint was a poorly functioning a/c that left us waking up drenched in sweat every few hours to reset the breaker due to an electrical short. You might want to also bring your own pillows as the two provided (one for a twin bed and one for an twin size air mattress) were extremely flat- we had to fold up some linens to stack on top. $6 uber from train or 10 minute walk to train like 25 minutes from manhattan. Place was nice with TV and air conditioning Becky is a super host! Excellent communication, super easy to work with, and outstanding value! Use of the whole apartment instead of just a bedroom for the price she charges is amazing! My stay was good. The place was neat and clean. Overall stay was good, just didnt like that i could hear everything outside the apartment while i was trying to sleep and the poor reception on the tv channels. Otherwise, great place to stay.\"),\n",

Migdalia will go above and beyond for you. Try and get there early the first night because she has to buzz you into her building however she will stay up for you. She has excellent customer service. The place is basically just somewhere to sleep and shower so if your looking something cheap just to sleep and head out then its perfect. Its not as clean as i would expect it to be but i guess for the price, thats what you get. Really great! Maggie is wonderful!

Jerry was very kind and fast responding on any request even weeks before we arrived. \\nJust 5 minutes away from the subway station Beverly Rd it was pretty easy to get into Manhattan or to Coney Island. \\nIt was perfect for our to two journey to New York. \\nThx a lot.  Jerryâ\\x80\\x99s place is the basement floor of his lovely house in Brooklyn. Almost halfway between Beverly road subway and Cortelyou subway on the Q line which runs to Manhattan and Coney Island. We usually went to Beverly to go to Manhattan which took about 4/5 mins walk and then about 35 mins/10 stops to Time square. We ate around Cortelyou for dinner many times as not much to our fancy around Beverly. Grocery stores also near Cortelyou for breakfast cereal and milk etc. The apartment itself is spacious and because is in the basement is nice and cool. Has some small windows for natural light and most importantly has air con. Jerry has a fully equipped kitchen with tea and coffee and and coffee machine which is a nice touch. Shower was good, bed comfortable and good tv with lots of channels after walking around he city all day. Jerry was also super accommodating letting us check in early and check out late due to our flight times which was a life safer! We really enjoyed our stay! I travelled with my best friend, and it was amazing. Jerry did so simple everything. The apartment is like the photos; so clean and comfortable. Itâ\\x80\\x99s near Q train (about 40â\\x80\\x99 to Manhattan; direct) and the neighbourhood is nice and quiet.  Definitely, I would come back! Jerry's basement apartment was great, and all you would ever need for a stay in NYC. It is very close to the metro station (Q line) which makes it very convenient to get in and out of Manhattan or down to Coney Island. I would not hesitate to stay again should I find my self back in the NYC region again. This place is HEAVEN. Had a great experience at Jerryâ\\x80\\x99s. Private, clean, perfect place to relax and close to Prospect Park. Will definitely be back the next time Iâ\\x80\\x99m in Brooklyn. Book this place! The apartment is lovely, very clean and stocked with everything you need. The location is great. The parking spot is an added perk. We parked the car and didn't use it until we left. We felt very safe and secure. Jerry and his wife are friendly and helpful. The communication was so detailed we didn't have any questions. This was our third time staying with Jerry.  The space is very clean and met all our needs.  Jerry is a great host. You will really enjoy staying at Jerry's appartment. His private and well appointed appartment has everything that you need, including special little touches in the kitchen and bathroom. Short and easy walk from the Subway. We recommend you stay at Jerry's. Lovely little studio apartment- perfect place to get around Brooklyn and New York. The studio was clean and tidy and there was lots of special touches and info and maps to get around. Jerry answered our messages immediately and was always happy to help us all he could. Wonderful stay and I would definitely return :) thank you Jerry. Wonderful base for NYC, furnished unit, Jerry was very quick for a couple questions, great deal for local stay too and Cafe Madeleine breakfast was good for two separate visits on Cortelyou st. 30-60 mins to Manhattan or even Astoria by subway ...\"),\n",

       "  \"This is a lovely apartment with a nice patio near Yankee stadium. Plenty of space for 6 people! Super clean, super nice apartment with plenty of sleeping space. Check in process was super easy and the hosts respond to messages very quickly. 10/10. This was a our most unpleasant Air BNB experience ever. The first thing you should know is that the apartment is dangerous. It has incorrectly installed Mortise lock on the apartment door. These locks, when engaged at the faceplate (the part on the side of the door), are supposed to lock the outside doorknob. This one however locks the inside doorknob as well. And since the lock can only be engaged/disengaged from the faceplate, once its locked and closed, you are out of luck if you are inside the apartment, which is what happened to us. Fortunately May's employee Sofia was in the building and was able to open the door from the outside with a key, but this could be very dangerous if there is a fire or other emergency situation where you need to leave quickly. May and Sofia insisted this was a safety feature but were unable to explain how locking their guests in the apartment would keep them safe. (Also, it seemed a bit unnecessary as there are two deadbolts on the door as well). To make matters worse, in my exchanges with May about the issue, she accused me of leaving my toddler in the apartment alone. The last thing I need on my vacation is someone judging my parenting, so this is really what knocked a few stars of my review. Sofia did find a temporary fix by taping over the faceplate so that the lock could not be engaged accidentally but I'm alarmed that they are unconcerned about how dangerous this is. Beyond that unpleasant experience, here are our pros and cons: PROS -Close to subway -Nice apartment--everything was clean and nicely decorated CONS -Terrace is badly misrepresented on the listing. When we arrived, it was flooded from raining and I had to ask Sofia to come back and get rid of the water. Then we saw how poorly maintained it was. The tiles are disintegrating (probably from constant flooding), the plants are dead, and the strings lights don't work. It rained again later in the week and we had to get Sofia to come back to get rid of the water again. -The kitchen is poorly stocked. We had to ask for additional silverware, it was missing some basics like a toaster, and there were no place mats or cloth napkins (which I usually see in my air bnbs). Sofia did drop off more silverware and the place mats and napkins but it was an additional interaction that should have been unnecessary. -There were not enough chairs for a group. Our first night, someone had to eat dinner standing up. We were six people, and this place is supposed to accommodate at least that. (There are only 4 chairs on the terrace.) -The location is pretty far from most of the tourist spots so be prepared for long subway trips (45-hour) to get downtown. -The volume of interaction I had to have with May and Sofia was just too much. While they... Beautiful apartment, spacious and very clean. Great place to stay for a trip to the big city.

My flights got diverted to and stuck in Washington Dulles, which was not even on my itinerary originally. Lina showed great flexibility and quick response when I updated her about my diverted flight. Although it was supposed to be just a delay of a few hours, my flight was cancelled entirely and customer service rescheduled my flight straight to Europe instead. Again, Lina was super kind and understanding; she even suggested that I would apply for a refund. She didn't have to do this, as the cancellation policy was strict and the rules are the rules.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s a very clean place. One of my best experiences at Airbnb so far. The restrooms were also very neatly kept. Defenitely would recommend it to anyone looking for a safe, quiet and comfortable stay. Jim and Lisa are super accommodating and always quickly available to assist in any matter that comes up. Rooms are clean and well equipped\\n Great hospitality! Private entrance makes it easy to come and go.  There is a bus stop nearby (Q65) that can take you to downtown Flushing, where you can transfer to Manhattan via the 7 train, so the location is nice. Very good place for a short term visitor. Once again I stayed at Jim and Lisaâ\\x80\\x99s residence on my trip to Queens.   As always the space is clean and tidy. The check in and check out process is smooth and flawless and there is plenty of street and driveway parking. If your coming to the area this is hands down a great place to stay. I will be back! Very safe, clean and quiet. In a good location near downtown Flushing and definitely one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in.'),\n",

Sandra's place is clean and great. The washroom is outside the room but it's not shared by anyone so it's a private washroom. AC is there so you can beat the heat.

We loved staying there and hopefully one day we will return. Thanks for the hospitality!!!! This is a spacious, renovated apartment in the beautiful, safe, family/pet-oriented neighborhood of ParkSlope, Brooklyn. The neighborhood is pedestrian-friendly, has tons of great restaurants you may walk to and the beautiful Prospect Park within 10 minutes walking distance where there is ample room to walk, bike and/or run. Street parking is a nightmare, so best to use public tansportation when visiting this area, which is user-friendly and inexpensive. Nice apartment in a great location in Park Slope.  Can comfortably sleep 2-3 people.  Included a lot of nice items in the kitchen for cooking (not a microwave). Amy was flexible with allowing us to leave our bags when we had a late flight and checking in early.  This is a great apartment to stay in if you want to be in the center of everything in Park Slope. We liked the idea of the having the keys in the lock box, so we didn't need to worry about bothering Amy or coordinating our schedules for check-in, particularly if our flight had been delayed. The apartment is beautiful, clean, and uncluttered. It is conveniently on the garden level, so no hauling suitcases up one or more flights of stairs. The location is perfect for us, only about a 5 minute walk to our daughter's apartment.  It is located on a quiet, tree-lined street of nice homes, but is close to great restaurants, a comfortable neighborhood pub, Prospect Park, the Park Slope Library, and the subway. The kitchen is modern, large, and well-equipped.  Although there is no dining table, we were perfectly comfortable eating at the very large counter on bar stools. The dishwasher is awesome--the quietest dishwasher I have ever seen. I want one!  I liked the light wood floors throughout that brightened the apartment and were very clean. I was happy not to have carpeting. We were there 6 nights and plan to stay at Amy's apartment on our future trips to Park Slope.  Amy's place was great and in a very nice neighborhood. The apartment was spacious and cozy and communication was made super simple and easy!  My parents stayed at Amy's place for 2 weeks while visiting me in NY. They have stayed in other AirBnb places in Park Slope previously, this is by far their favorite. Amy's place large & clean. The living room is comfortable and it comes with cable :) The bedroom is pretty sizable itself and the bed is very comfy. The kitchen is remodeled so it's almost brand new. Location - the place is very close to both 7th & 5th Avenue, where all the shops and restaurants are. When my parents were not babysitting their grandson, they were busy shopping and walking around.

We were coming in to town for a few days before heading on to Boston via train.   This place is a SHORT walk to Penn Station. \\nTo start, Brando was very accommodating for us.    We were flying in on a red-eye from LA, and were arriving at like 5:30am.    I asked how early we could get in....and fortunately the place was not occupied and Brando was gracious enough to allow us in early so we could rest and escape the heat.   \\nAlso, we happened to come when it was ridiculously hot....Rosa (who assists with Brando's unit), found us a fan to help in addition to the unit's air conditioning.  \\nThe place was super clean and tidy, and it had everything we needed.

Das Apartment war sauber, bis auf Haare in der Badewanne. Wenn man duscht, flieÃ\\x9ft das Wasser nicht richtig ab und steht einem bis zu den KnÃ¶cheln. Es gab reichlich Wasser und andere Lebensmittel, die uns zum Verzehr Ã¼berlassen wurden. \\nDas AP ist sehr schÃ¶n eingerichtet und bietet allen nÃ¶tigen Komfort. Fernsehen mit einer Online-Videothek, auch wenn es nicht immer 100%ig funktionierte. Leider war es nachts laut, da nebenan ein Nachtclub ist. Das hat gestÃ¶rt. In der letzten Nacht hat der Nachbar unter uns eine Party gemacht und die Musik war so laut, als wÃ¼rden die Boxen direkt in unserem Schlafzimmer stehen. Wir haben dann unsere Bettsachen genommen und im Wohnzimmer geschlafen. Einen Tag vor unserer Abreise wurde uns ein Late- Check- Out um 16:00 Uhr zugesagt, doch am spÃ¤ten Abend vor der Abreise - um 21:45 Uhr - bekam ich eine E-Mail, dass wir bereits um 11:00 Uhr auschecken sollten. Das war fÃ¼r uns extrem unpassend, da wir noch keine Koffer gepackt hatten und unser Flug erst am Abend stattfand. Wir baten darum, dann wenigstens unsere Koffer bis 15 Uhr im AP zu lassen, also bis zum Check-In der neuen GÃ¤ste. Doch Maria hat sie einfach in den Hausflur gestellt und nur den Summer bedient, damit wir die Koffer holen konnten. Sie hat sich nicht einmal vorgestellt und verabschiedet, obwohl sie in der Wohnung war.  It is a great place to live at. The apartment is very nicely furnished and very clean. There are so many amenities that come with this apartment. The subway stop is also right down the street and there are a lot of restaurant really close to the apartment. Although there is a nightclub near this apartment, it is not very loud at night. This apartment is also remodeled to look very nice. I would recommend this apartment to anyone. I traveled with 3 friends to Brooklyn for the weekend, and Mariaâ\\x80\\x99s place was the perfect home away from home while we were there! Gorgeous space, spacious and so close to the subway! Couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have asked for a better spot! \\nA caution for anyone not used to city sounds, the music at the bar next door is pretty loud Saturday night. Iâ\\x80\\x99d recommend earplugs for country folks! We had 3 wonderful days in N.Y . The place was ok because the price was cheap but there were a few things that were unpleasant . Two of the beds were very hard , a bit of music at night but not too loud and the distance from New York can be considered far . (45â\\x80\\x99 at least from Times Square ) and the neighborhood is ok but not really beautiful . \\nBut as I said it was cheap for N.Y so weâ\\x80\\x99ll say that overall it was ok.

Michael was always quick to respond and help out with anything we needed. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting NYC! The studio is just as beautiful as pictured.  We loved having a quiet and light-filled space to come home to after a busy day in the city.  Due to the location, we were able to get some coffee to go and then just walk over to Central Park and start every day on a bench in Central Park.  After that, we were fortified to brave the crowds at the museum, High Line, etc.  This is a quieter and less-touristy area of the City, and of course there are restaurants within walking distance, but we found it more convenient to just plan out somewhere to eat near whatever activity we were out doing that day.  We had a lovely visit.\\nThe host: MJ is a very gracious and patient host, and was kind enough to help me with a last-minute request which helped us out considerably.  He responded very quickly when I contacted him.  In addition, he enhanced our stay with some ideas of things to do - one of them was riding bikes on the dedicated bike path along the Hudson, which turned out to be our favorite part of our visit (very safe!).  In short,  the host is just as great as the studio.  Great experience. Great location. Great location! This is a beautiful, cozy apartment in a wonderful location!  It's a block and a half from Central Park. The area feels extremely safe. Great places to eat all around. MJ met us at check in and was very warm and accommodating.

The place is well-connected and looks like on the pictures. There was a TV in the room on which you could use Netflix, HULU etc. which was great for rainy days. If you spend a lot of time in NY with another person and you have a lot of stuff, this room can become easily clattered as it is quite small once the second bed is out. The place is generally clean and has all the things you need. Getting your towels dry can be quite hard when it's summertime as it was really humid inside the room but I guess this would be an issue anywhere in NY in August. To cool ourselves down, there was an Aircon, however, which was much needed after a long day out in the heat. We were out most of the time during the day and the flat was a comfortable place to get back to in the evening. There were corner shops all around and there are some good restaurants if you take the B60 up to Wilson Avenue/Starr Street (Amaranto is THE place if you like Mexican food). The host Jaye always responded promptly and helped us find a place to hang out at on our first day as we arrived a little too early to check in.  great vibe from the space and the host. very close or not far from several useful trains. a late-night corner store on the block was super welcome. the weekend i stayed had quite a lot of very late night noise every night, but that may have just been my luck. It was a good time there. We have lots to say from our 1  night stay at Jaye's place but we only noted here a few things. The apartment was not very clean, the pictures are a bit misleading as far as cleanliness goes. Fridge was disgusting. you could see fingerprints and other stains on the fridge as well as the walls. Hosts were rude via virtual communication (text and through Airbnb app). However, the hosts are pretty quick with response time and they live in the basement of the unit you will be staying in so that's beneficial in case you do need anything asap. Patio area outdoors wreaked of some foul odor (like deification or maybe some garbage nearby). Bring your own food if you're staying long term or be prepared to do some shopping, they only provide you with tap water to drink. They have snacks that you can purchase from them for a ridiculously pricey amount, luckily there is a 24hour convenience store downstairs. **Also beware that there are a lot more house rules than they have posted on the listing such as you cannot use the kitchen fridge, there is a camera in the common area (for your safety of course but you are not made aware of this until after you confirm your reservation), they restrict what household appliances you may use...etc but dont fret too much about that because they label everything... literally.

What we need they have already provided them in their airbnb place.we have just asked for a better iron which one they left in their storage was old and they immediately gave us the one that they use in their own place. If i leave in new york i would definitely ask them if they make a lease that place for a year:) and  also the neigborhood is just like heaven. We love the neighbors who lives next door too.they were so sweet. They invited us to their backyard many times while we were playing with our son in our backyard cuz they were there with their grandson:)thank you so much again for everything especially for your interest and effort while solving the transaction error on airbnb website which is occured when we book your place and also when we wanted to extend our stay in your place for one week more. Excellent place to stay.  Everything was fantastic,   the place, the amenities, the communication with the host.  I would recommend this place to anyone who expects to have a good confortable place to stay. My parents stayed here for a week, and were absolutely thrilled with the space! It was spotlessly clean, comfy bed, great water pressure, and very spacious. Hilary and her husband were very easy to communicate with and handled our few small requests expeditiously. My parents are already looking forward to staying here again! Very clean place. Comfort peaceful. Great place to stay. I will recommend this place to anyone 100%.

Shaina was an amazing host! The place is well located near a metro station. We really enjoyed staying with Shaina! Shaina was super helpful about everything. She allowed me to leave my stuff in the apartment the day I checked out, and to collect it later because I had a later flight which made it super convenient for me. Communication was easy and great. I enjoyed my stay in NYC and would definitely come back to book her airbnb. Shaina was around to answer all my questions and helped me to get into the apartment with ease. The location is great and super near the subway as promised which made traveling to manhattan super easy. The neighborhood is safe and I enjoyed walking around and exploring! A place I would definitely recommend to others. We only stay for one night so we didn't use a lot of the amenities, Shaina was super responsive, the room was spacious and clean. Unfortunately, we didn't have a pleasant night because it was pretty hot that night and the fan wasn't too powerful (even at the highest setting). Also, despite of other traveler's comments, for us, the bed wasn't comfortable, even my friend spent a porting of the night on the floor, but again this is relative and other people have commented the bed is comfortable, unfortunately it didn't work for us. \\n\\nBesides that, our stay was good, Shaina and her puppy were super friendly. My recommendation to Shaina is to have thinner sheets available since the ones on the bed were way to hot and we couldn't use them; maybe just for the summer hot days. Also, my friend forgot something there and we were able to pick it up afterwards. Thanks Shaina! Itâ\\x80\\x99s close to Times Square!maybe it takes 20minutes. Itâ\\x80\\x99s very good location!\\nAnd host is very kind!\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s awesome!!!! I really like Shainaâ\\x80\\x99s place Shaina was very nice and helpful host. Her apartment is, as is said, very close to the metro station in a lovely neighborhood. We didn't really use the kitchen, because we were out all day, but her room is spacious, clean and has a comfy bed. She responds on messages very quickly and is open to answer on any questions. Also, she has the cutest dog ever! All in all, would highly recommend! I didn't spent much time in the house, I was always in a rush! But the place was super clean and Shaina was super nice, had a really good experience. Great location, very close to subway. Room is very spacious and host is very responsive. It is an older apartment building, easy to find and access; taking the stairs is the easiest way up. Older, creaky bed with mattress topper, only a mattress cover provided and no sheets or blankets. Ambient noise from road and subway and solid blinds only on one of the two windows so also ambient light from street. There were some cockroaches at night and the puppy is active in the morning. Overall, great location if you are looking for somewhere close to the 7 line. you can find everything you need in the room. Shaina was very nice and a great host. Communication was perfect. We could even leave our suitcases after check out. She gave us free comedy tickets that we couldnâ\\x80\\x99t use because we didnâ\\x80\\x99t have enough time. She gave us tips where to eat and how to get around. The house had an elevator which was pretty nice cause we had lots of luggage. The area was nice and safe.

Now, I should be the one asking for some refund and I may just commence the process ; maybe I should get my attorneys in Houston involved in this . Great space.  Very large for Manhattan.

The apartment is located across from an elementary school. \\nAllie was very helpful as far as parking on the street rules and regulations so as to not get fined as well as other parking amenities. Subway entrances are less than five blocks away and easy to use with the MyMTA App. During our five day stay we visited the other boroughs of New York City and staying in east Harlem was the most enjoyable with its history, cultural content and is much less congested than the other boroughs. \\nOverall as far as security, amenities, location, and cutting costs, this is a great place to stay. Allie was very easy to work with and is a great host. Allies cohost stopped by to make sure everything was up to par and to answer any additional questions we had. Allies apartment was affordable and incredibly cozy for a group of travellers. It was a clean and classy apartment in a quiet street in otherwise busy Harlem. Allie was responsive and made everything very easy for us. Would highly recommend Allie's apartment to a group of travellers looking for somewhere to stay in New York City.

Great location, in lively neighborhood with easy access to both the L train, and to a nearby boardwalk that gives a great view of Manhattan from across the East River. \\n\\nThe interior was beautiful, with tons of open space and high ceilings. The bed was the most comfortable I've had the pleasure of sleeping on at an airbnb. I would definitely stay here again. Nichelina's place is a large (well sized) semi-studio / 1 bedroom apartment in the heart of Williamsburg. The location is fantastic. You feel right amongst the BK community. It's a short walk in any direction to nice cafes and stores. It's about a 10 minute walk to the L train and 18 minutes to the M train. The apartment was great for me as a solo traveller, and is easily just as suitable for couples (given its size). The apartment is up four (wide) flights of stairs, I was okay with this, as it's the trade-off for staying in a converted warehouse. Air con in the apartment also made up for the flights of stairs.  Loft magnifiquement dÃ©corÃ© dans un quartier trÃ¨s vivant (plein cÅ\\x93ur de Williamsburg)  ! Bon accueil et lâ\\x80\\x99hÃ´te est arrangeante. Tout Ã©tait trÃ¨s bien.\"),\n",

This place is SUPER minimal, great for just needing a place to sleep.

Would definitely stay again Great location, easy to find, near everything you need  Great location and thank god for the AC unit in the room! This place was nice! I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know it was a shared space prior to arriving, so realizing there were guests staying in the other bedroom was interesting. On the bright side they were decent people! Nice location. Parking was a pain, but figured it out. Great location to lots of great shops and restaurants.   Yevgeny was very prompt with getting back in touch with any questions and/or concerns. He was very friendly allowing us spend the day there despite it being after check out when we had to wait around  and encouraged us to go see the city. With lots of advice   Convenient location (couple of blocks from the metro) and nice strong A/C unit for the summer nights. Yevgeny made check-in/check-out easy, and even gave us the option to leave our luggage there after checking-out. Be mentally prepared that the bedroom and bathroom are very small, and you'll likely be sharing the bathroom with other guests. It's not a luxurious stay, but it does the job!  Yevgeny was a great host. Arranging for keys was super easy. Instructions and communication was clear and he was super fast to respond to any questions. The space is comfortable and has everything you need. Bed was comfy and room has air conditioning.  Solid stay here. Yevgeny was very nice. There are a couple flights of stairs to climb up to the apartment, which is rather compact. Best parts were: Location \\nHost's accomodation to park luggage after checkout while you explore the city. Very nice place in Manhattan \\n Yevgeny's place is a very nice place to stay very convent location. Lots of places to eat and plenty of bars to grab a drink. Walking distance to central park and only two blocks away from the subway. I would definitely recommend staying here.  Yevgeny's place on the Upper East Side was in a perfect location, close to public transportation, central park and lots of restaurants. Perfect for a quick visit to the city! Easy to check in and out as well!  Great location! Bed in air-conditioned room was super comfy. Interaction with host and housekeeper were very pleasant, and Yevgeny quickly replies to any and all questions. A great stay! El departamento es pequeÃ±o pero cÃ³modo y limpio, tiene lo necesario para descansar, cumple con las expectativas, Yevgeny estÃ¡ atento y responde rÃ¡pido en caso de algÃºn contratiempo. Great location and good room in New York City! This apartment is near to some of attractions and subway Small place but very good value for the location.  Fast communication.  Everything as described.  Make sure you can check in by 1am though since host had to leave key at a nearby convenience store which closes at 1. Met our needs in a good location for a good price.

The bathroom was a little bit dirty but all in all the Apartment was clean :) thank you so much! Yevgeny wasnâ\\x80\\x99t only a wonderful host to me but also a life-saver. The check-in procedure is very convenient: you pick up the keys left for you at the shop that is open until 1am;  but unfortunately my flight was 6 hours delayed and I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t make it there before the shop closes. I texted Yevgeny pretty much hopeless but he did everything in his power to help me, found a 24h open location for me where I could pick up the keys and ensured everything was ok.

The neighborhood is very nice not to mention a CVS and 7/11 right around the corner for that midnight snack, I personally had a great experience staying here! Zdenka's house was really great.

Would highly recommend!  Itâ\\x80\\x99s a great apartment !  Great location and easy access close to everything. Max was really helpful when I got locked out of my room and came over right away. I felt a little funny with someone sleeping in the kitchen though. Stayed at this place for a couple nights during the US Open. If you're looking to save some money and just coming back here to sleep at night, this will do. I was staying alone in one of the three rooms of this apartment and only came back at night to sleep. There is a kitchen with a couple pots to use for cooking or heating up food, but note that there is no microwave. The fridge has a ton of space to store food though.\\n\\nDepending on how many people are in the apartment, there is only one small bathroom available for use. Depending on who is staying in it and how clean they are, that will impact the cleaniness of the bathroom. I did notice the toilet trash got taken out daily though so I'm pretty sure someone comes to tidy up pretty regularly. \\n\\nSince it was during a hot and humid summer Labor Day weekend, A/C was a must. It is provided in the room and works well, but once you are in the kitchen it can be a 10 - 15 degree difference. The bathroom also has a fan but it can also get warm there. So in short, if you're staying here over the summer, as long as you remain in your room it's not too bad but it does get warmer in the shared spaces. \\n\\nThere are plenty of food options nearby, particularly a pizza and South Indian spot that's just a few steps away with other main restaurants 5-10 minutes away on Kissena. If you just need a place to crash and don't want to be spending more money, this place is a good spot. Also near a bunch of large green spaces which I used for a morning run.\"),\n",

Comfortable bed. Ceiling fan and window AC unit - excellent!\\nThe location was very good. A block from the #1 subway which runs north and south (uptown -downtown) and drops off very close to fun tourist things like Times Square and Rockefeller Center. About 3 blocks walk to Central Park. I rented a bike from the docked bike stands (which are everywhere) and had a fun ride all around the park, then docked my bike at the south end of the park and rode the #1 back to Ronnie's.\\nAlso 1 block to a good sized city grocery store plus a million little restaurants. \\n\\nI had a great mini vacation in the city.

The location is very good - just a couple of minutes to the 1 train, which will take you to Times Square (and onwards to everywhere) in less than 30 minutes. The room is clean, with linen and towels provided, and it's a real bonus to have a washer and dryer available within the apartment, as well as cooking facilities and space in the shared refrigerator. There's also a 24-hour McDonald's right nearby, if you need food late at night on the way back.\\n\\nMy only advice on this venue is to note that there is no air-conditioning provided in the room. This is stated in the listing and thus not false advertising. However, it does get uncomfortably hot and humid at the height of summer in New York. On some of those nights, I found it too warm to get to sleep comfortably. The hosts were kind enough to provide a fan, and Dee also suggested leaving the door ajar to bring in some of the AC from the living room. But this room is at the end of a long hallway, so that isn't very effective - and wouldn't work if you'd rather sleep with the door closed/locked.

Would definitely recommend his place! Great place, very clean and great amenities. Host was great perfect clean room The apartment was very clean in a great neighborhood. It was only a few blocks away from the subway and there were plenty of restaurants nearby as well. I would recommend Gesnerâ\\x80\\x99s place to anyone visiting NYC\"),\n",

       "  'William and his wife made sure when we arrived we had milk for coffee and they even offered a bottle of wine and some snack. They even put nice bath salt and shampoo if the bathroom for us. There are clear written instructions throughout the house. The beds are super comfortable. The area is safe and quiet. The Metro is nearby and takes about 30 mins to the Manhattan area and 2 blocks to the beautiful prospect park. William is very responsive and always trying to make sure we have everything we need and have us tips for restaurants, farmers markets and shopping. The kitchen is amazing. Our son loved the house! We had a fantastic time! Highly recommend! This is a truly lovely home in a great location. Park Slope being one of the truly great neighborhoods in New York and among the top 2-3 in Brooklyn, it\\'s a great find.\\n\\nLocation- the location is fantastic and right near a subway as well as a \"main street\" type neighborhood section that has everything you may need for a visit. Venturing a little further into Park Slope and you find a ton of great restaurants and local favorite places. The park, however, is a big draw- we walked there with my two kids every morning for a good long stroll and it was the perfect way to start a day.\\n\\nHouse and amenities- the feel is very private and very \"Brooklyn\" with the house being situated on a classic street with multi level living. The first floor kitchen and garden are really a beautiful scene- the type of place you want to gather and chill and cook. It was raining during a lot of our visit so we had the screen doors closed to the backyard and the breeze was top notch. There is a great TV with a sound lover\\'s sound system installed in the ceiling above- very cool. Our younger kids were very comfortable as well and the house was great for them too.\\n\\nThe warmth of the hosts and the feeling of the house is hard to ignore. We felt very welcome and had a great time. We have family in Brooklyn and expect to be back (if they\\'ll have us haha!). '),\n",

When u need tips to go to visit some places, they are sÃºper helpful, cant wait to be there again! Totally recomended! I would highly recommend Derek's place.  Great location, close to the subways.  Also, walking distance to the 9/11 Memorial and Statue of Liberty  along with other noteworthy sites.  Hosts were very accomodating and made me feel very comfortable.  This was my first time in New York and I'm so happy i stayed  here!  Will definitely return to Derek's place.  His fiancÃ© is a gem! Derek and Angela were the perfect hosts. Our room and private bath were exactly as described and our stay was amazing. The apartment is very clean and I felt right at home. They gave us tips on where to go and even made coffee for us in the morning. This place is in the perfect neighborhood and was close to the subway.

We walked down a few blocks and there is the time square!\\nAs for the apartment, the beds were very comfortable. The shower was enjoyable with strong water pressure. The kitchen was fully-equipped with everything we needed. We enjoyed our stay and will certainly recommend this apartment! Thanks Aden for being a wonderful host! This is a great place that accommodates a large group. Excellent location with big rooms comfy beds and wonderful showers! Great communication by the host and he is so accommodating with check-in and out times. I would definitely stay again and recommend to friends. We will definitely recommend Aden place to friends and family. We were 6 adults total and 3 infants and we had more than enough space, privacy and was perfect!We were in the heart of the city without the noise of the city. Whole Foods was 2 blocks away and was nice not to have to eat out for every meal. Truly enjoyed our trip and my best friend has never used airbnb was very skeptical but this experience made her a believer. My 3 colleagues & I had a fabulous time and the location was perfect.Great location and the home is spectacular! Definitely a great option for families or larger groups. The hosts were very responsive with communication ... prior to, during, and after our stay. Aden was very prompt in getting back to me and answering all my questions. I highly recommend booking this place if you plan on visiting NYC! My friends and I had a wonderful stay at Adenâ\\x80\\x99s! It was clean, accommodating and in a very central location in the city. I would highly recommend for a group of friends or family for a getaway to NYC! Thank you for everything! Amazing apartment in a FANTASTIC location. Everything you need is here, including a well-stocked kitchen and towels.Aden was quick to respond with any thoughts or concerns we had, his apartment was the perfect size and in just the right location for our group of 6. Very cool bars and shops just feet away for our door. Overall we had an amazing experience and would definitely stay in his place again! If youâ\\x80\\x99re planning to stay in New York Adenâ\\x80\\x99s apartment is the perfect place for it! We absolutely loved our stay at Aden\\'s place. The place is clean, beautiful and was plenty of room for 3 adults and 2 children. The convenient location meant that we could walk everywhere and come back to \"home base\" easily during our NYC adventures,basically 2 blocks away from Times Square. We will definitely be back to stay again! Aden is a great guest, very flexible and attentive. Great experience. Adenâ\\x80\\x99s place was perfect! We were 4 guests, but there was room for more!! The apt is really clean and spacious. He let us have an early check in, and when we got there he was waiting for us with breakfast. He kept in touch with us all our trip.

Aden was a terrific host who greeted us when we arrived.  He was very responsive to all our needs. The apt is only blocks away from Time\\'s Square, Broadway shows, Rockefeller centre. We took the subway to Staten Island ferry then walked back to the apt, stopping at the 911 memorial, art galleries and cafe\\'s of Tribecca and SoHo and had ice cream in the West Village.  We walked to Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum.  We ran on the HighLine and back along the Hudson River.  We walked to Broadway shows and had NYC street food one night and higher end meals on others. We had breakfast every morning in Aden\\'s apt. We really loved this place! It is exactly as pictured, the location is great.We had a great stay at Aden\\'s place. It was extremely hot in NY when we were there and it was great to go in to a nice and air conditioned apartment to cool off from the heat. The apartment is in Hell\\'s Kitchen with some great restaurants near by. The place was incredibly clean and very comfortable,would definitely recommend Aden\\'s place if you are visiting NYC.Perfect accommodations for a family of 6. Location and size is great! When we arrived there was a box of old pizza in the oven. Also saw a mouse crawling around twice. Once when I was in the bathroom, gave me quite a fright lol. But overall great experience.

The apartment  itself is not dirty. The bathroon is seriously tiny.  The art, which is cool  and that you see in the photos, was unsettling in real life and full-size- especially if you have little kids which we do. The kids in the photos are put in adult situations- one little boy is holding guns, one little kid is holding a champagne bottle, and then there's the woman recovering from an intense evenning with caviar spread all over her- my kids thought it was guts or blood- obviousy I explained the art and we have a house filled with all kinds of art- but the overall effect is dark. Beautiful sexy, young girls and children in adult situations. Should have thought twice about how the art would effect the overall stay- given that it's so large. L'appartement d'Ilo est trÃ¨s bien situÃ© et permet d'accÃ©der facilement Ã\\xa0 tous les points stratÃ©giques de NY. Il est propre et bien Ã©quipÃ©.

Everything was just as described and the location was perfect for getting anywhere (a short walk from Grand Central, and lots of restaurant choices, Trader Joe's, etc. right in the neighborhood).  The bed was superb (comfort of mattress, pillows, and linens) and the apartment itself was full of thoughtful touches and so peaceful - as it's on the back of the building all we heard in the evenings was birds going to sleep in the courtyard, and seeing green trees out the window was really refreshing.  Definitely the most peaceful nights I have ever had in NYC!  Key pickup and drop off from a lockbox was secure and convenient.  I can't recommend Adrienne highly enough as a hostess. Adrienne is an immensely considerate, thoughtful and helpful host. She is extremely communicative and quick to reply if any issues arrive. She also goes above and beyond what is normally expected in ensuring that guests feel completely at home (even including a small box of emergency toiletries in case guests have forgotten any!). The apartment is very good value considering the excellent location and the space it provides. All in all, I recommend this apartment extremely highly! We enjoyed our stay in this centrally located apartment, which is very quiet and has an excellent bed.    It was very clean and had all the amenities we needed.  It is also an excellent value.  Adrienne was able to accomodate our last minute request to come a day early and was easy to communicate with.  FYI the key pick up is about 8-9 blocks away, so plan a little extra time for that when you arrive and depart.  The only negative  is that there is little natural light, at least in the summer, as it is a ground floor apartment.  However we were out and about during the day, so it was not a problem for us. My boyfriend and I stayed here for a total of 9 days on a big NYC trip for the summer. The location of Adrienneâ\\x80\\x99s place is phenomenal. It is central to all major attractions and subway stations. It is also a safe area and very homey. Bed is very comfortable and considering this is New York it is actually great space for two-three people. The place is very clean and very well priced. Adrienne answers promptly and is a great resource for suggestions on anything to do in the city. There are restaurants and even a washeteria nearby if needed. The WiFi works very fast as well.

This place is amazing, clean, modern, to much room for a NY apartment, great building with all services and close to main attractions. I really enjoyed my stay. If you are going to visit NY, this place is best deal for you. I have to say, Vicky and Traccy are great people. Wir waren in einer Wohnung, die wir nicht gebucht hatten, die nicht sauber, die kleiner und auf niedrigerem Niveau und schlechter ausgestattet war. Die Hausregeln erlauben wohl eigentlich keine Vermietung an Airbnb, wir wurden deshalb vom \"Building Manager\" fÃ¼r einige Zeit festgehalten. Vic\\'s place is too good to be true....\\n\\nA great price and a great location is hard to come by in NY. You get these, but you pay for it with the challenges of the house in general.\\n\\nCheck in was very convoluted. We were given the wrong address with the listing. Last minute the host told us it was a different address because of Airbnb laws needing to cause things to be under the radar. Host told us to meet at a hotel, was 30 minutes late to meet us, checking in was very challenging as we were not allowed to talk and had to be careful of everything we did and said because I didn\\'t want to try to find a new place to stay in NY. Very frustrating, especially since we came with children.\\n\\nDidn\\'t have enough beds for us. Pictures aren\\'t even of the house we stayed in. Was told in listing there was to be cable and there was no cable, only Netflix and HULU\\n\\nTook multiple days for responses from main host. When we were staying there, we didn\\'t even get responses for 24 hours from main host, but from his girlfriend via text is all we got.\\n\\nGreat location, great price, difficult to benefit with all of the challenges.\\n\\nPictures are not of the actual property. House rules were texted as opposed to via airbnb to show accuracy. Beds were different than expected. My son had to sleep on a small little couch that only a 5 year old could fit on which is a good thing he is 5. Didn\\'t have the bed for a 6th person so they had to bring it in later. Didn\\'t have enough sheets and blankets for everyone so they had to drop off more.\\n\\nIt was a great location. It was a great price. We had a great time in NY. Just know what you are getting yourself into if you stay at Vic\\'s house Nice, clean place in the middle of Wall Street. Great access to the Financial District, near everything.  Bello The photos of the advertisement are misleading and the place does not look like any of it on the photos. The kitchen did not have any sugar, salt, pepper or olive oil which should be in any kitchen available to make some breakfast. The shower curtain was smelly and dirty, it should be renewed. \\n\\nHowever, the beds were nice and comfy and the check-in procedures were very clear.

       "  \"Wonderful location right in hells kitchen. Would definitely book with Shunichi again! Shunichi was very nice and kind. \\n Das Apartment zeichnet sich fÃ¼r Urlauber durch seine top Lage aus. \\nJedoch sind viele andere Dinge sehr dÃ¼rftig ausgefallen.\\nDas â\\x80\\x9aSchlafzimmerâ\\x80\\x98 war weitestgehend in Ordnung, von einem WohlfÃ¼hlfaktor konnten wir jedoch nicht sprechen. \\nIm Bad schimmelte es Ã¼berall, an der Badewanne, den DuschvorhÃ¤ngen und der Einrichtung befanden sich Schichten von Dreck, Rost und anderen undefinierbaren Dingen, was eine Dusche zu einem eher unangenehmen Erlebnis machte. Zudem fehlte an 2 von 7 Tagen warmes Wasser und im Bad befanden sich einige gebrauchte Ã\\x9cberreste an Rasierern, Duschgels etc. von vorherigen GÃ¤sten - auch nicht sehr lecker. \\nDie ausgeschriebene KÃ¼che war extrem verdreckt, was aber eigentlich keine Rolle spielte, da der Raum, in dem sie sich befand, nicht zugÃ¤nglich und somit fÃ¼r uns nicht nutzbar war. Wir wurden in jenem Raum kurz â\\x80\\x9ageparktâ\\x80\\x98, als eine â\\x80\\x9aFreundinâ\\x80\\x98, von ihm, die uns auch in Empfang nahm, bei unserer Ankunft erst einmal unser Zimmer sauber machte.. das aber auch eher sporadisch. \\nDie Klimaanlage im â\\x80\\x9aSchlafzimmerâ\\x80\\x98 funktionierte zwar, das jedoch eher halblebig; ein kÃ¼hles Zimmer hatten wir jedenfalls nicht, und das sehr zu unserem Leidwesen, da es im New Yorker Hochsommer dringend nÃ¶tig gewesen wÃ¤re.\\nWir mussten ihm am Anreisetag nach mehrfachem Anschreiben hinterher telefonieren, wann wir das Zimmer denn jetzt beziehen dÃ¼rfen. Obwohl er jeden Abend zu Hause war kam kein einziger persÃ¶nlicher Kontakt zu Stande, was wir sehr schade und auch befremdlich fanden, da wir ja TÃ¼r an TÃ¼r wohnten. Check-Out Belange klÃ¤rte er dann auch lieber Ã¼ber die App, sprich die Gastgeberrolle wurde hier nicht wirklich wahrgenommen.\\nDer Preis war fÃ¼r diese tolle Lage unglaublich gut, alles andere jedoch hat einen nicht zum Verweilen verleiten kÃ¶nnen. Mehr als â\\x80\\x9ageschlafenâ\\x80\\x98, unser GepÃ¤ck geparkt und geduscht haben wir dort nicht. It was in an amazing location for a really good price! Looking for a good place to crash for a few days at Shunichi's place is a good idea. Though it was very hot and hard to sleep, Shunichi provided us with another air con and it worked well. The bathroom had some stains, grime and mold. There were old curtains but it got the job done. The bedroom was dusty and dark but the bed was a good size and the host/host's friend provided us more blankets and pillows if needed. Overall, for the price and location, it's definitely a steal. But the cleanliness can be worked on.  This is my first Airbnb stay and I am very satisfied. I felt safe in this location and my room was clean and spacious. I would request this Airbnb in my future trips to NYC. Excellent location to experience Manhattan La habitaciÃ³n estaba algo sucia aunque las sÃ¡banas estaban limpias. El baÃ±o estaba sucio, sobre todo la ducha (moho en techo y cortinas de baÃ±o). El pasillo estaba lleno de trastos y olÃ\\xada un poco a humedad (es un bloque de edificios antiguo). Por otro lado, Shunichi fue muy educado aunque distante, como si no estuviese en casa. Nos dio facilidades para dejar la maleta en el pasillo el Ãºltimo dÃ\\xada hasta que cogimos el aviÃ³n. Lo mÃ¡s importante del apartamento es que estÃ¡ muy bien situado (entre Central Park y Times Square). Si no eres muy escrupuloso por lo del baÃ±o (y te llevas unas chanclas), en general estÃ¡ bien para lo que pagas. Si eres muy fino, busca otro. Just saw sunichi once when he leave the Keys so we really didnt get the chance to Know him\\n\\nThe room is big and very well located, with microwave and fridge. \\n\\nA great bud get option for manhattan, near central park and times square\"),\n",

You have to be mindful of the noise because the walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors and they can hear you. So it might not be the best if you are a light sleeper but overall we loved it.

But the bed is comfortable, you get a closet, and a mini fridge and a table and chairs for you to enjoy breakfast privately. The common area is really clean,  and modern.

Overall the lodging was quite basic but the location and cleanliness were excellent.  There was an initial mix up in communication but everything worked out well!  Saige is a considerate host!  Excellent value accomodation near JFK airport. Great place and location to stay A-V-O-I-D this NIGHTMARE!!! Read the fine print folks and save yourself an uncomfortable and miserable experience. The listing shows towels and air conditioning are not provided. The towel wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a huge deal and I came prepared, but I overlooked the lack of air conditioning and that was a huge problem. The room was located on the top floor and directly under the roof. I measured the temperature in my room at one point during the day in excess of 100 degrees! Yes, the fan was on and the window was open but under a roof in the summer you are in an oven, so prepare to sweat all night long in your heat-soaked room while listening to honking horns, roaring trucks and emergency vehicle sirens from the interstate directly next to this property. If the sweltering heat doesnâ\\x80\\x99t and constant noise donâ\\x80\\x99t keep you up, try sleeping on the homemade pillow stuffed with pieces of old foam and hand sewn then covered in 3 layers of pillow cases so the decomposing foam dust doesnâ\\x80\\x99t escape. I had the distinct displeasure of having no toilet paper in the bathroom when I needed it, nor was it found under the sink or in any of the cabinets. Letâ\\x80\\x99s just say there is nothing worse than needing paper and not having it! After I complained, a cheap 50-cent roll of toiler paper was provided. I assume additional paper is not present as it may be a concern a client could take it with them just as their towels were previously taken and subsequently no longer offered. Why someone would think it is acceptable to not provide the WiFi access information is beyond me. EVERY Airbnb host I have encountered previously, except this one, has provided the WiFi information and placed it visibly in the room. This host insisted on personally entering the WiFi information direclty into my device stating it was â\\x80\\x9cpersonalâ\\x80\\x9d WiFi and a security problem. I was insulted at the implication I would somehow misuse this information or even post it so people can hang out in front of the house and use the WiFi. News flash folks, just because you are the one to type the WiFi password into a device does not mean it cannot be extracted. It literally takes me less than a minute to get that password from the device so, what you are doing is only alienating and inconveniencing your customers. Further, since I checked in late, no one was available to provide the WiFi information and we missed each other during the day due to conflicting schedules, thus I was never able to access the WiFi during my stay and actually had to go use an internet cafÃ©. The hostâ\\x80\\x99s communication is terrible and never once responded to any text or phone call I sent to the phone number provided in the confirmation email. I was not able to login to my Airbnb account to message them and had to get the Airbnb customer service... A very comfortable place to stay after a long trip.  Great location, great host, great value for money. I recommend this place for anyone looking for an affordable place close to JFK. Nice room. Close to JFK. 5 min to bus stop and 5 mins to JFK by bus. Far and complicated to get to the Manhattan. Far from metro (subway). Good place if you have just long layover.\"),\n",

I had a really good stay at Chaseâ\\x80\\x99s place and would definitely stay there again. Highly recommended. Chase's place was easy to find, exactly as described, as his hosting was awesome. Cosmo is also the friendliest cat you'll ever meet.\"),\n",

       "  \"LOCATION, LOCATION,LOCATION This place is a bargain for it's size and location but it's by no means luxury. Good location, AC was a life saver, and the furniture/decor we're good. \\n\\nThat being said, there are a lot of maintenance items that would go a long way. There is small hole in the bathroom wall from doorknob hitting it, the bathroom door jam was broken when we got there and the front door lock doesn't really inspire confidence. Additionally, the door to get into the building is very tricky and requires a lot of finessing with the key. Great location, stylish place, pretty clean.\\n\\nBut construction site next door starting at 8am and no dark curtains which can prevent hard sleepers from sleeping Nice place, large, 3 comfortable bedrooms. Walking distance from everything in the city we came to see. Directly above a good bar. We loved the location and proximity to great coffee, bars and places to eat. It was easy to access by foot using the subway.  The trash cans in the corridor made the ascent and descent very stinky but the apartment smelled fine and was very clean and orderly. We loved our stay and would stay there again for sure.  I was most impressed by the communications.  Great location both for enjoying the immediate pleasures of the LES and for getting uptown.  Two dads and two sons had a really fun time.  Apartment clean and functional was just what we needed. We enjoy the location! There are parking lots and subway stations nearby, so you can easily have access  to your car or take a subway if you need to. The appartment was beautiful decorated and the services was really good.  Great location ! Ryanâ\\x80\\x99s locations was perfect for our needs and we got quick responses and accurate directions from his emails. Thanks for a great space for us all. We were 7 girls!  Great location but run down apartment  Great place, super clean....and there was a great TV with all the proper connectivity packages - the host was super responsive and accommodating about early arrival. A great place in a great neighborhood.  Excelente servicio. Llegamos y todo estaba cÃ³mo se nos indicÃ³. El lugar es el mismo de las fotografÃ\\xadas. Al principio cuesta ubicarse porque es una escalera algo escondida, pero el resto ok. El metro estÃ¡ a pasos por ende tiene muy buena ubicacion. Si no tienen problema con el ruido de la calle, lugar perfecto  Wonderful apartment! Ryanâ\\x80\\x99s place was nicely decorated and very cozy. It was very clean and had everything we needed for a great stay. Itâ\\x80\\x99s also in an awesome area.  The house is big and clean, in a perfect location. Communication was easy and Ryan was responding quickly to all my messages. Thank you! Ryan was great with giving us local transportation tips and taking care of any issues we did have. Great host. Communication with Ryan was easy and helpful. The apartment is in a good location, connection to public transport is close and a few bars and clubs are just around the corner. Two beds were nearly broken, which made sleeping experience terrible. \\n\\nThe front door lock was brute forced on our arrival. When fixed later by our request it was still almost unusable. \\n\\nThe apartment is not clean. \\n\\nI strongly donâ\\x80\\x99t recommend staying at this place unless Ryan takes measures.\"),\n",

Close to public transit, and Clay was so nice and helpful. Clay is an awesome host! Everything is just as pictured, and this location is AMAZING. Stay here, you won't regret it.  We had a wonderful time at Clay's place. Clay was communicative and flexible with our late check-in, which was greatly appreciated. His place was bigger than expected, and centrally located so that we could visit Central Park every morning and walk almost everywhere. Highly recommend this place! Great host and great location!  Much better value than hotels in the area and easy access to public transportation.  Host was flexible and responsive, making for a stress-free stay. Clays place was exactly what we needed. Great location. Better than hotel. Will come back for sure. \\nClay was kind and and answered all our questions.\"),\n",
